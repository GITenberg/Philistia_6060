    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; CHILDREN OF LIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Sunday evening, and on Sundays Max Schurz, the chief of the London
      Socialists, always held his weekly receptions. That night his cosmopolitan
      refugee friends were all at liberty; his French disciples could pour in
      from the little lanes and courts in Soho, where, since the Commune, they
      had plied their peaceful trades as engravers, picture-framers, artists&rsquo;-colourmen,
      models, pointers, and so forth&mdash;for most of them were hangers-on in
      one way or another of the artistic world; his German adherents could
      stroll round, pipe in mouth, from their printing-houses, their
      ham-and-beef shops, or their naturalists&rsquo; chambers, where they
      stuffed birds or set up exotic butterflies in little cabinets&mdash;for
      most of them were more or less literary or scientific in their pursuits;
      and his few English sympathisers, chiefly dissatisfied philosophical
      Radicals of the upper classes, could drop in casually for a chat and a
      smoke, on their way home from the churches to which they had been
      dutifully escorting their un-emancipated wives and sisters. Max Schurz
      kept open house for all on Sunday evenings, and there was not a
      drawing-room in London better filled than his with the very advanced and
      not undistinguished set who alone had the much-prized entrée of his
      exclusive salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salon itself did not form any component part of Max Schurz&rsquo;s own
      private residence in any way. The great Socialist, the man whose mandates
      shook the thrones of Russia and Austria, whose movements spread terror in
      Paris and Berlin, whose dictates were even obeyed in Kerry and in Chicago,
      occupied for his own use two small rooms at the top of a shabby composite
      tenement in a doubtful district of Marylebone. The little parlour where he
      carried on his trade of a microscope-lens grinder would not have sufficed
      to hold one-tenth of the eager half-washed crowd that pressed itself
      enthusiastically upon him every Sunday. But a large room on the ground
      floor of the tenement, opening towards the main street, was used during
      the week by one of his French refugee friends as a dancing-saloon; and in
      this room on every Sunday evening the uncrowned king of the proletariate
      Socialists was permitted to hold his royal levees. Thither all that was
      best and truest in the socially rebellions classes domiciled in London
      used to make its way; and there men calmly talked over the ultimate
      chances of social revolutions which would have made the hair of
      respectable Philistine Marylebone stand stiffly on end, had it only known
      the rank political heresies that were quietly hatching in its unconscious
      midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Max Schurz&rsquo;s hall was rapidly filling with the polyglot crowd
      of democratic solidarists, Ernest Le Breton and his brother were waiting
      in the chilly little drawing-room at Epsilon Terrace, Bayswater, for the
      expected arrival of Harry Oswald. Ernest had promised to introduce Oswald
      to Max Schurz&rsquo;s reception; and it was now past eight o&rsquo;clock,
      getting rather a late hour for those simple-minded, early-rising
      Communists. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Herbert,&rsquo; said Ernest to his
      brother, &lsquo;he forgets that Max is a working-man who has to be at his
      trade again punctually by seven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow. He thinks he&rsquo;s
      going out to a regular society At Home, where ten o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;s
      considered just the beginning of the evening. Max won&rsquo;t at all like
      his turning up so late; it smells of non-productivity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If Herr Schurz wants to convert the world,&rsquo; Herbert answered
      chillily, rolling himself a tiny cigarette, &lsquo;he must convince the
      unproductive as well as the proletariate before he can set things fairly
      on the roll for better arrangement. The proletariate&rsquo;s all very well
      in its way, no doubt, but the unproductive happen to hold the key of the
      situation. One convert like you or me is worth a thousand ignorant
      East-end labourers, with nothing but their hands and their votes to count
      upon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But you are not a convert, Herbert.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I didn&rsquo;t say I was. I&rsquo;m a critic. There&rsquo;s no necessity
      to throw oneself open-armed into the embrace of either party. The wise man
      can wait and watch the progress of the game, backing the winner for the
      time being at all the critical moments, and hedging if necessary when the
      chances turn momentarily against the favourite. There&rsquo;s a ring at
      the bell: that&rsquo;s Oswald; let&rsquo;s go down to the door to meet
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest ran down the stairs rapidly, as was his wont; Herbert followed in a
      more leisurely fashion, still rolling the cigarette between his delicate
      finger and thumb. &lsquo;Goodness gracious, Oswald!&rsquo; Ernest
      exclaimed as his friend stepped in, &lsquo;why, you&rsquo;ve actually come
      in evening dress! A white tie and all! What on earth will Max say? He&rsquo;ll
      be perfectly scandalised at such a shocking and unprecedented outrage.
      This will never do; you must dissemble somehow or other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswald laughed. &lsquo;I had no idea,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Herr Schurz
      was such a truculent sans-culotte as that comes to. As it was an evening
      reception I thought, of course, one ought to turn up in evening clothes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Evening clothes! My dear fellow, how on earth do you suppose a set of
      poor Leicester Square outlaws are going to get themselves correctly set up
      in black broadcloth coats and trousers? They might wash their white ties
      themselves, to be sure; they mostly do their own washing, I believe, in
      their own basins.&rsquo; (&lsquo;And not much at that either,&rsquo; put
      in Herbert, parenthetically.) &lsquo;But as to evening clothes, why, they&rsquo;d
      as soon think of arraying themselves for dinner in full court dress as of
      putting on an obscurantist swallow-tail. It&rsquo;s the badge of a class,
      a distinct aristocratic outrage; we must alter it at once, I assure you,
      Oswald.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘At any rate,&rsquo; said Oswald laughing, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had the
      pleasure of finding myself accused for the first time in the course of my
      existence of being aristocratic. It&rsquo;s quite worth while going to Max
      Schurz&rsquo;s once in one&rsquo;s life, if it were only for the sake of
      that single new sensation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, my dear fellow, we must rectify you, anyhow, before you go. Let me
      see; luckily you&rsquo;ve got your dust-coat on, and you needn&rsquo;t
      take that off; it&rsquo;ll do splendidly to hide your coat and waistcoat.
      I&rsquo;ll lend you a blue tie, which will at once transform your upper
      man entirely. But you show the cloven hoof below; the trousers will surely
      betray you. They&rsquo;re absolutely inadmissible under any circumstances
      whatsoever, as the Court Circular says, and you must positively wear a
      coloured pair of Herbert&rsquo;s instead of them. Run upstairs quickly,
      there&rsquo;s a good fellow, and get rid of the mark of the Beast as fast
      as you can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswald did as he was told without demur, and in about a minute more
      presented himself again, with the mark of the Beast certainly most
      effectually obliterated, at least so far as outer appearance went. His
      blue tie, light dust-coat, and borrowed grey trousers, made up an ensemble
      much more like an omnibus conductor out for a holiday than a gentleman of
      the period in correct evening dress. &lsquo;Now mind,&rsquo; Ernest said
      seriously, as he opened the door, &lsquo;whatever you do, Oswald, if you
      stew to death for it&mdash;and Schurz&rsquo;s rooms are often very close
      and hot, I can assure you&mdash;don&rsquo;t for heaven&rsquo;s sake go and
      unbutton your dust-coat. If you do they&rsquo;ll see at once you&rsquo;re
      a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, and I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all
      surprised if they were to turn and rend you. At least, I&rsquo;m sure Max
      would be very much annoyed with me for unsocially introducing a
      plutocratic traitor into the bosom of the fold.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along briskly in the direction of Marylebone, and stopped at
      last at a dull, yellow-washed house, which bore on its door a very dingy
      brass plate, inscribed in red letters, &lsquo;M. et Mdlle. Tirard. Salon
      de Danse.&rsquo; Ernest opened the door without ringing, and turned down
      the passage towards the salon. &lsquo;Remember,&rsquo; he said, turning to
      Harry Oswald by way of a last warning, with his hand on the inner
      door-handle, &lsquo;coûte que coûte, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t on any
      account open your dust-coat. No anti-social opinions; and please bear in
      mind that Max is, in his own way, a potentate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The big hall, badly lighted by a few contribution candles (for the whole
      colony subscribed to the best of its ability for the support of the weekly
      entertainment), was all alive with eager figures and the mingled busy hum
      of earnest conversation. A few chairs ranged round the wall were mostly
      occupied by Mdlle. Tirard and the other ladies of the Socialist party; but
      the mass of the guests were men, and they were almost all smoking, in
      utter indifference to the scanty presence of the fair sex. Not that they
      were intentionally rude or boorish; that they never were; except where an
      emperor or an aristocrat is concerned, there is no being on earth more
      courteous, kindly, and considerate for the feelings of others than your
      exiled Socialist. He has suffered much himself in his own time, and so
      miseris succurrere discit. Emperors he mentally classes with cobras,
      tarantulas, and scorpions, as outside the pale of humanitarian sympathies
      altogether; but, with this slight political exception, he is the broadest
      and tenderest and most catholic in his feelings of all living breathing
      creatures. However, the ladies of his party have all been brought up from
      their childhood onward in a mingled atmosphere of smoke and democracy; so
      that he no more thinks of abstaining from tobacco in their presence than
      he thinks of commiserating the poor fish for being so dreadfully wet, or
      the unfortunate mole for his unpleasantly slimy diet of live earthworms.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Herr Schurz,&rsquo; said Ernest, singling out the great leader in the
      gloom immediately, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought my brother Herbert here, whom
      you know already, to see you, as well as another Oxford friend of mind,
      Mr. Harry Oswald, Fellow and Lecturer of Oriel. He&rsquo;s almost one of
      us at heart, I&rsquo;m happy to say, and at any rate I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll
      be glad to make his acquaintance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little spare wizened-up grey man, in the threadbare brown velveteen
      jacket, who stood in the middle of the hall, caught Ernest&rsquo;s hand
      warmly, and held it for a moment fettered in his iron grip. There was an
      honesty in that grip and in those hazy blue-spectacled eyes that nobody
      could for a second misunderstand. If an emperor had been introduced to Max
      Schurz he might have felt a little abashed one minute at the old Socialist&rsquo;s
      royal disdain, but he could not have failed to say to himself as he looked
      at him from head to foot, &lsquo;Here, at least, is a true man.&rsquo; So
      Harry Oswald felt, as the spare grey thinker took his hand in his, and
      grasped it firmly with a kindly pressure, but less friendly than that with
      which he had greeted his known admirer, Ernest Le Breton. As for Herbert,
      he merely bowed to him politely from a little distance; and Herbert, who
      had picked up at once with a Polish exile in a corner, returned the bow
      frigidly without coming up to the host himself at all for a moment&rsquo;s
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m always pleased to meet friends of the cause from Oxford,&rsquo;
      Herr Schurz said, in almost perfect English. &lsquo;We want recruits most
      of all among the thinking classes. If we are ever to make headway against
      the banded monopolies&mdash;against the place-holders, the land-grabbers,
      the labour-taxers, the robbers of the poor&mdash;we must first secure the
      perfect undivided confidence of the brain-workers, the thinkers, and the
      writers. At present everything is against us; we are but a little leaven,
      trying vainly in our helpless fashion to leaven the whole lump. The
      capitalist journals carry off all the writing talent in the world; they
      are timid, as capital must always be; they tremble for their tens of
      thousands a year, and their vast circulations among the propertied
      classes. We cannot get at the heart of the people, save by the Archimedean
      lever of the thinking world. For that reason, my dear Le Breton, I am
      always glad to muster here your Oxford neophytes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And yet, Herr Schurz,&rsquo; said Ernest gently, &lsquo;you know we must
      not after all despair. Look at the history of your own people! When the
      cause of Jehovah seemed most hopeless, there were still seven thousand
      left in Israel who had not bowed the knee to Baal. We are gaining strength
      every day, while they are losing it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah yes, my friend. I know that too,&rsquo; the old man answered, with a
      solemn shake of the head; &lsquo;but the wheels move slowly, they move
      slowly&mdash;very surely, but oh, so slowly. You are young, friend Ernest,
      and I am growing old. You look forward to the future with hope; I look
      back to the past with regret: so many years gone, so little, so very
      little done. It will come, it will come as surely as the next glacial
      period, but I shall not live to see it. I stand like Moses on Pisgah; I
      see the promised land before me; I look down upon the equally allotted
      vineyards, and the glebe flowing with milk and honey in the distance; but
      I shall not lead you into it; I shall not even lead you against the
      Canaanites; another than I must lead you in. But I am an old man, Mr.
      Oswald, an old man now, and I am talking all about myself&mdash;an
      anti-social trick we have inherited from our fathers. What is your friend&rsquo;s
      special line at Oxford, did you say, Ernest?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oswald is a mathematician, sir,&rsquo; said Ernest, &lsquo;perhaps the
      greatest mathematician among the younger men in the whole University.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! that is well. We want exact science. We want clear and definite
      thinking. Biologists and physicists and mathematicians, those are our best
      recruits, you may depend upon it. We need logic, not mere gas. Our French
      friends and our Irish friends&mdash;I have nothing in the world to say
      against them; they are useful men, ardent men, full of fire, full of
      enthusiasm, ready to do and dare anything&mdash;but they lack ballast. You
      can&rsquo;t take the kingdom of heaven by storm. The social revolution is
      not to be accomplished by violence, it is not even to be carried by the
      most vivid eloquence; the victory will be in the end to the clearest brain
      and the subtlest intellect. The orthodox political economists are clever
      sophists; they mask and confuse the truth very speciously; we must have
      keen eyes and sharp noses to spy out and scent out their tortuous
      fallacies. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re a mathematician, Mr. Oswald. And so
      you have thought on social problems?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have read &ldquo;Gold and the Proletariate,&rdquo;&rsquo; Oswald
      answered modestly, ‘and I learned much from it, and thought more. I won&rsquo;t
      say you have quite converted me, Herr Schurz, but you have given me plenty
      of food for future reflection.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That is well, said the old man, passing one skinny brown hand gently up
      and down over the other. &lsquo;That is well. There&rsquo;s no hurry. Don&rsquo;t
      make up your mind too fast. Don&rsquo;t jump at conclusions. It&rsquo;s
      intellectual dishonesty to do that. Wait till you have convinced yourself.
      Spell out your problems slowly; they are not easy ones; try to see how the
      present complex system works; try to probe its inequalities and
      injustices; try to compare it with the ideal commonwealth: and you&rsquo;ll
      find the light in the end, you&rsquo;ll find the light.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Herbert Le Breton lounged up quietly from his farther corner
      towards the little group. &lsquo;Ah, your brother, Ernest!&rsquo; said Max
      Schurz, drawing himself up a little more stiffly; &lsquo;he has found the
      light already, I believe, but he neglects it; still he is not with us, and
      he that is not with us is against us. You hold aloof always, Mr. Herbert,
      is it not so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, not quite aloof, Herr Schurz, I&rsquo;m certain, but not on your
      side exactly either. I like to look on and hold the balance evenly, not to
      throw my own weight too lightly into either stale. The objective attitude
      of the mere spectator is after all the right one for an impartial
      philosopher to take up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, Mr. Herbert, this philosophy of your Oxford contemplative Radicals is
      only another name for a kind of social selfishness, I fancy,&rsquo; said
      the old man solemnly. &lsquo;It seems to me your head is with us, but your
      heart, your heart is elsewhere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Le Breton played a moment quietly with the Roman aureus of
      Domitian on his watch-chain; then he said slowly in his clear cold voice,
      &lsquo;There may be something in that, no doubt, Herr Schurz, for each of
      us has his own game to play, and while the world remains unreformed, he
      must play it on his own gambit to a great extent, without reference to the
      independent game of others. We all agree that the board is too full of
      counters, and as each counter is not responsible for its own presence and
      position on the board, having been put there without previous consultation
      by the players, we must each do the best we can for ourselves in our own
      fashion. My sympathies, as you say, are on your side, but perhaps my
      interests lie the other way, and after all, till you start your
      millennium, we must all rattle along as well as we can in the box
      together, jarring against one another in our old ugly round of
      competition, and supply and demand, and survival of the fittest, and
      mutual accommodation, and all the rest of it, to the end of the chapter.
      Every man for himself and God for us all, you know. You have the logic, to
      be sure, Herr Schurz, but the monopolists have the law and the money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes,&rsquo; said the old Socialist grimly; &lsquo;Demas, Demas; he
      and his silver mine; you remember your Bunyan, don&rsquo;t you? Well, all
      faiths and systems have their Demases. The cares of this world and the
      deceitfulness of riches. He&rsquo;s bursar of his college, isn&rsquo;t he,
      Ernest? I thought so. &ldquo;He had the bag, and bare what was put
      therein.&rdquo; A dangerous office, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Oswald? A very
      dangerous office. You can&rsquo;t touch pitch or property without being
      defiled.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You at least, sir, said Ernest, reverentially, &lsquo;have kept yourself
      unspotted from the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sighed, and turned for a moment to speak in French to a tall,
      big-bearded new-comer who advanced to meet him. &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo;
      he said quickly; &lsquo;I am truly distressed to hear it. It is very
      imprudent, very unnecessary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is the news?&rsquo; asked Ernest, also in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer answered him with a marked South Russian accent. ‘There has
      been another attempt on the life of Alexander Nicolaiovitch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You don&rsquo;t mean to say so!&rsquo; cried Ernest in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I do,&rsquo; replied the Russian, &lsquo;and it has nearly succeeded
      too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An attempt on whom?&rsquo; asked Oswald, who was new to the peculiar
      vocabulary of the Socialists, and not particularly accustomed to following
      spoken French.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘On Alexander Nicolaiovitch,&rsquo; answered the red-bearded stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not the Czar?&rsquo; Oswald inquired of Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, the one whom you call Czar,&rsquo; said the stranger, quickly, in
      tolerable English. The confusion of tongues seemed to be treated as a
      small matter at Max Schurz&rsquo;s receptions, for everybody appeared to
      speak all languages at once, in the true spirit of solidarity, as though
      Babel had never been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswald did not attempt to conceal a slight gesture of horror. The tall
      Russian looked down upon him commiseratingly. &lsquo;He is of the Few?&rsquo;
      he asked of Ernest, that being the slang of the initiated for a member of
      the aristocratic and capitalist oligarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not exactly,&rsquo; Ernest answered with a smile; &lsquo;but he has not
      entirely learned the way we here regard these penal measures. His
      sympathies are one-sided as to Alexander, no doubt. He thinks merely of
      the hunted, wretched life the man bears about with him, and he forgets
      poor bleeding, groaning, down-trodden, long-suffering Russia. It is the
      common way of Englishmen. They do not realise Siberia and Poland and the
      Third Section, and all the rest of it; they think only of Alexander as of
      the benevolent despot who freed the serf and befriended the Bulgarian.
      They never remember that they have all the freedom and privileges
      themselves which you poor Russians ask for in vain; they do not bear in
      mind that he has only to sign his name to a constitution, a very little
      constitution, and he might walk abroad as light-hearted in St. Petersburg
      to-morrow as you and I walk in Regent Street to-day. We are mostly
      lopsided, we English, but you must bear with us in our obliquity; we have
      had freedom ourselves so long that we hardly know how to make due
      allowance for those unfortunate folks who are still in search of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you had an Alexander yourselves for half a day,&rsquo; the Russian
      said fiercely, turning to Oswald, &lsquo;you would soon see the
      difference. You would forget your virtuous indignation against Nihilist
      assassins in the white heat of your anger against unendurable tyranny. You
      had a King Charles in England once&mdash;the mere shadow of a Russian Czar&mdash;and
      you were not so very ceremonious with him, you order-loving English, after
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is a foolish thing, Borodinsky,&rsquo; said Max Schurz, looking up
      from the long telegram the other had handed him, &lsquo;and I told
      Toroloff as much a fortnight ago, when he spoke to me about the matter.
      You can do no good by these constant attacks, and you only rouse the minds
      of the oligarchy against you by your importunity. Bloodshed will avail us
      nothing; the world cannot be regenerated by a baptism like that. Every
      peasant won over, every student enrolled, every mother engaged to feed her
      little ones on the gospel of Socialism together with her own milk, is
      worth a thousand times more to us and to the people than a dead Czar. If
      your friends had really blown him up, what then? You would have had
      another Czar, and another Third Section, and another reign of terror, and
      another raid and massacre; and we should have lost twenty good men from
      our poor little side for ever. We must not waste the salt of the earth in
      that reckless fashion. Besides, I don&rsquo;t like this dynamite. It&rsquo;s
      a bad argument, it smacks too much of the old royal and repressive method.
      You know the motto Louis Quatorze used to cast on his bronze cannon&mdash;&ldquo;Ultima
      ratio regum.&rdquo; Well, we Socialists ought to be able to find better
      logic for our opponents than that, oughtn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But in Russia,&rsquo; cried the bearded man hotly, &lsquo;in poor
      stricken-down groaning Russia, what other argument have they left us? Are
      we to be hunted to death without real law or trial, tortured into sham
      confessions, deluded with mock pardons, arraigned before hypocritical
      tribunals, ensnared by all the chicanery, and lying, and treachery, and
      ferreting of the false bureaucracy, with its spies, and its bloodhounds,
      and its knout-bearing police-agents; and then are we not to make war the
      only way we can&mdash;open war, mind you, with fair declaration, and due
      formalities, and proper warning beforehand&mdash;against the irresponsible
      autocrat and his wire-pulled office-puppets who kill us off mercilessly?
      You are too hard upon us, Herr Schurz; even you yourself have no sympathy
      at all for unhappy Russia.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked up at him tenderly and regretfully. &lsquo;My poor
      Borodinsky,&rsquo; he said in a gentle tremulous voice, &lsquo;I have
      indeed sympathy and pity in abundance for you. I do not blame you; you
      will have enough and to spare to do that, even here in free England; I
      would not say a harsh word against you or your terrible methods for all
      the world. You have been hard-driven, and you stand at bay like tigers.
      But I think you are going to work the wrong way, not using your energies
      to the best possible advantage for the proletariate. What we have really
      got to do is to gain over every man, woman, and child of the
      working-classes individually, and to array on our side all the learning
      and intellect and economical science of the thinking classes individually;
      and then we can present such a grand united front to the banded
      monopolists that for very shame they will not dare to gainsay us. Indeed,
      if it comes to that, we can leave them quietly alone, till for pure hunger
      they will come and beg our assistance. When we have enticed away all the
      workmen from their masters to our co-operative factories, the masters may
      keep their rusty empty mills and looms and engines to themselves as long
      as they like, but they must come to us in the end, and ask us to give them
      the bread they used to refuse us. For my part, I would kill no man and rob
      no man; but I would let no man kill or rob another either.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And how about Alexander Nicolaiovitch, then?&rsquo; persisted the
      Russian, eagerly. &lsquo;Has he killed none in his loathsome prisons and
      in his Siberian quicksilver mines? Has he robbed none of their own hardly
      got earnings by his poisoned vodki and his autocratically imposed taxes
      and imposts? Who gave him an absolute hereditary right to put us to death,
      to throw us in prison, to take our money from us against our will and
      without our leave, to treat us as if we existed, body and soul, and wives
      and children, only as chattels for the greater glory of his own orthodox
      imperial majesty? If we may justly slay the highway robber who meets us,
      arms in hand, in the outskirts of the city, and demands of us our money or
      our life, may we not justly slay Alexander Nicolaiovitch, who comes to our
      homes in the person of his tax-gatherers to take the bread out of our
      children&rsquo;s mouths and to help himself to whatever he chooses by the
      divine right of his Romanoff heirship? I tell you, Herr Max, we may
      blamelessly lie in wait for him wherever we find him, and whoso says us
      nay is siding with the wolf against the lambs, with the robber and the
      slayer against the honest representative of right and justice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I never met a Nihilist before,&rsquo; said Oswald to Ernest, in a
      half-undertone,&rsquo; and it never struck me to think what they might
      have to say for themselves from their own side of the question.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That&rsquo;s one of the uses of coming here to Herr Schurz&rsquo;s,&rsquo;
      Ernest answered quickly. &lsquo;You may not agree with all you hear, but
      at least you learn to see others as they see themselves; whereas if you
      mix always in English society, and read only English papers, you will see
      them only as we English see them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But just fancy,&rsquo; Oswald went on, as they both stood back a little
      to make way for others who wished for interviews with the great man,
      &lsquo;just fancy that this Borodinsky, or whatever his name may be, has
      himself very likely helped in dynamite plots, or manufactured
      nitro-glycerine cartridges to blow up the Czar; and yet we stand here
      talking with him as coolly as if he were an ordinary respectable innocent
      Englishman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What of that?&rsquo; Ernest answered, smiling. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t we
      meet Prince Strelinoffsky at Oriel last term, and didn&rsquo;t we talk
      with him too, as if he was an honest, hard-working, bread-earning
      Christian? and yet we knew he was a member of the St. Petersburg office
      clique, and at the bottom of half the trouble in Poland for the last ten
      years or so. Grant even that Borodinsky is quite wrong in his way of
      dealing with noxious autocrats, and yet which do you think is the worst
      criminal of the two&mdash;he with his little honest glazier&rsquo;s shop
      in a back slum of Paddington, or Strelinoffsky with his jewelled fingers
      calmly signing accursed warrants to send childing Polish women to die of
      cold and hunger and ill-treatment on the way to Siberia?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, really, Le Breton, you know I&rsquo;m a passably good Radical, but
      you&rsquo;re positively just one stage too Radical even for me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come here oftener,&rsquo; answered Ernest; &lsquo;and perhaps you&rsquo;ll
      begin to think a little differently about some things.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later in the evening Max Schurz found Ernest alone in a quiet
      corner. &lsquo;One moment, my dear Le Breton,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you
      know I always like to find out all about people&rsquo;s political
      antecedents; it helps one to fathom the potentialities of their
      characters. From what social stratum, now, do we get your clever friend,
      Mr. Oswald?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘His father&rsquo;s a petty tradesman in a country town in Devonshire, I
      believe,&rsquo; Ernest answered; &lsquo;and he himself is a good general
      democrat, without any very pronounced socialistic colouring.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A petty tradesman! Hum, I thought so. He has rather the mental bearing
      and equipment of a man from the petite bourgeoisie. I have been talking to
      him, and drawing him out. Clever, very, and with good instincts, but not
      wholly and entirely sound. A fibre wrong somewhere, socially speaking, a
      false note suspected in his ideas of life; too much acquiescence in the
      thing that is, and too little faith or enthusiasm for the thing that ought
      to be. But we shall make something of him yet. He has read &ldquo;Gold&rdquo;
      and understands it. That is already a beginning. Bring him again. I shall
      always be glad to see him here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I will,&rsquo; said Ernest, &lsquo;and I believe the more you know him,
      Herr Max, the better you will like him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what did you think of the sons of the prophets?&rsquo; asked Herbert
      Le Breton of Oswald as they left the salon at the close of the reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Frankly speaking,&rsquo; answered Oswald, looking half aside at Ernest,
      ‘I didn&rsquo;t quite care for all of them&mdash;the Nihilists and
      Communards took my breath away at first; but as to Max Schurz himself I
      think there can be only one opinion possible about him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That he&rsquo;s a magnificent old man, with a genuine apostolic
      inspiration. I don&rsquo;t care twopence whether he is right or wrong, but
      he&rsquo;s a perfectly splendid old fellow, as honest and transparent as
      the day&rsquo;s long. He believes in it all, and would give his life for
      it freely, if he thought he could forward the cause a single inch by doing
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re quite right,&rsquo; said Herbert calmly. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      an Elijah thrown blankly upon these prosaic latter days; and what&rsquo;s
      more, his gospel&rsquo;s all true; but it doesn&rsquo;t matter a sou to
      you or me, for it will never come about in our time, no nor for a century
      after. &ldquo;Post nos millennium.&rdquo; So what on earth&rsquo;s the
      good of our troubling our poor overworked heads about it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He&rsquo;s the only really great man I ever knew,&rsquo; said Ernest
      enthusiastically, &lsquo;and I consider that his friendship&rsquo;s the
      one thing in my life that has been really and truly worth living for. If a
      pessimist were to ask me what was the use of human existence, I should
      give him a card of introduction to go to Max Schurz&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Excuse my interrupting your rhapsody, Ernest,&rsquo; Herbert put in
      blandly, &lsquo;but will you have your own trousers tonight, Oswald, or
      will you wear mine back to your lodgings now, and I&rsquo;ll send one of
      the servants round with yours for them in the morning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thanks,&rsquo; said Harry Oswald, slapping the sides of the unopened
      dust-coat; &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go home as I am at present, and I&rsquo;ll
      recover the marks of the Beast again to-morrow. You see, I didn&rsquo;t
      betray my evening waistcoat after all, now did I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they parted at the corner, each of them going his own way in his own
      mood and manner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE COASTS OF THE GENTILES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The decayed and disfranchised borough of Calcombe Pomeroy, or
      Calcombe-on-the-Sea, is one of the prettiest and quietest little
      out-of-the-way watering-places in the whole smiling southern slope of the
      county of Devon. Thank heaven, the Great Western Railway, when planning
      its organised devastations along the beautiful rural region of the South
      Hams, left poor little Calcombe out in the cold; and the consequence is
      that those few people who still love to linger in the uncontaminated
      rustic England of our wiser forefathers can here find a beach unspoiled by
      goat-carriages or black-faced minstrels, a tiny parade uninvaded by stucco
      terraces or German brass bands, and an ancient stone pier off which
      swimmers may take a header direct, in the early morning, before the
      sumptuary edicts of his worship the Mayor compel them to resort to the use
      of bathing-machines and the decent covering of an approved costume,
      between the hours of eight and eight. A board beside the mouth of the
      harbour, signed by a Secretary of State to his late Majesty King William
      the Fourth, still announces to a heedless world the tolls to be paid for
      entry by the ships that never arrive; and a superannuated official in a
      wooden leg and a gold cap-band retains the honourable sinecure of a
      harbour-mastership, with a hypothetical salary nominally payable from the
      non-existent fees and port dues. The little river Cale, at the bottom of
      whose combe the wee town nestles snugly, has cut itself a deep valley in
      the soft sandstone hills; and the gap in the cliffs formed by its mouth
      gives room for the few hundred yards of level on which the antiquated
      little parade is warmly ensconced. On either hand tall bluffs of brilliant
      red marl raise their honeycombed faces fronting the sea; and in the
      distance the sheeny grey rocks of the harder Devonian promontories gleam
      like watered satin in the slant rays of the afternoon sun. Altogether a
      very sleepy little old-world place is Calcombe Pomeroy, specially reserved
      by the overruling chance of the universe to be a summer retreat for quiet,
      peace-loving, old-world people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Londoner who escapes for a while from the great teeming human
      ant-hill, with its dark foggy lanes and solid firmament of hanging smoke,
      to draw in a little unadulterated atmosphere at Calcombe Pomeroy, finds
      himself landed by the Plymouth slow train at Calcombe Road Station, twelve
      miles by cross-country highway from his final destination. The little grey
      box, described in the time-tables as a commodious omnibus, which takes him
      on for the rest of his journey, crawls slowly up the first six miles to
      the summit of the intervening range at the Cross Foxes Inn, and jolts
      swiftly down the other six miles, with red hot drag creaking and groaning
      lugubriously, till it seems to topple over sheer into the sea at the
      clambering High Street of the old borough. As you turn to descend the
      seaward slope at the Cross Foxes, you appear to leave modern industrial
      England and the nineteenth century well behind you on the north, and you
      go down into a little isolated primaeval dale, cut off from all the outer
      world by the high ridge that girds it round on every side, and turned only
      on the southern front towards the open Channel and the backing sun.
      Half-way down the steep cobble-paved High Street, just after you pass the
      big dull russet church, a small shop on the left-hand side bears a
      signboard with the painted legend, &lsquo;Oswald, Family Grocer and
      Provision Dealer.&rsquo; In the front bay window of that red-brick house,
      built out just over the shop, Harry Oswald, Fellow and Lecturer of Oriel
      College, Oxford, kept his big oak writing-desk; and at that desk he might
      be seen reading or writing on most mornings during the long vacation,
      after the end of his three weeks&rsquo; stay at a London West-end
      lodging-house, from which he had paid his first visit to Max Schurz&rsquo;s
      Sunday evening receptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Two pounds of best black tea, good quality&mdash;yours is generally
      atrocious, Mrs. Oswald&mdash;that&rsquo;s the next thing on the list,&rsquo;
      said poor trembling, shaky Miss Luttrell, the Squire&rsquo;s sister, a
      palsied old lady with a quavering, querulous, rasping voice. &lsquo;Two
      pounds of best black tea, and mind you don&rsquo;t send it all dust, as
      you usually do. No good tea to be got nowadays, since they took the duties
      off and ruined the country. And I see a tall young man lounging about the
      place sometimes, and never touching his hat to me as he ought to do. Young
      people have no manners in these times, Mrs. Oswald, as they used to have
      when you and I were young. Your son, I suppose, come home from sea or
      something? He&rsquo;s in the fish-curing line, isn&rsquo;t he, I think I&rsquo;ve
      heard you say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t rightly know who &lsquo;ee may mean, Miss Luttrell,&rsquo;
      replied the mother proudly, &lsquo;by a young man lounging about the
      place; but my son&rsquo;s at home from Oxford at present for his
      vacations, and he isn&rsquo;t in the fish-curing line at all, ma&rsquo;am,
      but he&rsquo;s a Fellow of his college, as I&rsquo;ve told &lsquo;ee more
      than once already; but you&rsquo;re getting old, I see, Miss Luttrell, and
      your memory isn&rsquo;t just what it had used to be, dost know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, at Oxford, is he?&rsquo; Miss Luttrell chimed on vacantly, wagging
      her wrinkled old head in solemn deprecation of the evil omen. She knew it
      as well as Mrs. Oswald herself did, having heard the fact at least a
      thousand times before; but she made it a matter of principle never to
      encourage these upstart pretensions on the part of the lower orders, and
      just to keep them rigorously at their proper level she always made a feint
      of forgetting any steps in advance which they might have been bold enough
      to take, without humbly obtaining her previous permission, out of their
      original and natural obscurity. &lsquo;Fellow of his college is he,
      really? Fellow of a college! Dear me, how completely Oxford is going to
      the dogs. Admitting all kinds of odd people into the University, I
      understand. Why, my second brother&mdash;the Archdeacon, you know&mdash;was
      a Fellow of Magdalen for some time in his younger days. You surprise me,
      quite. Fellow of a college! You&rsquo;re perfectly sure he isn&rsquo;t a
      National schoolmaster at Oxford instead, and that you and his father haven&rsquo;t
      got the two things mixed up together in your heads, Mrs. Oswald?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, ma&rsquo;am, we&rsquo;in perfectly sure of it, and we haven&rsquo;t
      got the things mixed up in our heads at all, no more nor you have, Miss
      Luttrell. He was a scholar of Trinity first, and now he&rsquo;s got a
      Fellowship at Oriel. You must mind hearing all about it at the time, only
      you&rsquo;re getting so forgetful like now, with years and such like.&rsquo;
      Mrs. Oswald knew there was nothing that annoyed the old lady so much as
      any allusion to her increasing age or infirmities, and she took her
      revenge out of her in that simple retributive fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A scholar of Trinity, was he? Ah, yes, patronage will do a great deal in
      these days, for certain. The Rector took a wonderful interest in your boy,
      I think, Mrs. Oswald. He went to Plymouth Grammar School, I remember now,
      with a nomination no doubt; and there, I dare say, he attracted some
      attention, being a decent, hard-working lad, and got sent to Oxford with a
      sizarship, or something of the sort; there are all kinds of arrangements
      like that at the Universities, I believe, to encourage poor young men of
      respectable character. They become missionaries or ushers in the end, and
      often get very good salaries, considering everything, I&rsquo;m told.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There you&rsquo;re wrong, again, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; put in Mrs. Oswald,
      stoutly. ‘My husband, he sent Harry to Plymouth School at our own expense;
      and after that he got an exhibition from the school, and an open
      scholarship, I think they call it, at the college; and he&rsquo;s been no
      more beholden to patronage, ma&rsquo;am, than your brother the Archdeacon
      was, nor for the matter o&rsquo; that not so much neither; for I&rsquo;ve
      a&rsquo;ways understood the old Squire sent him first to the Charterhouse,
      and afterwards he got a living through Lord Modbury&rsquo;s influence, as
      the Squire voted regular with the Modbury people for the borough and
      county. But George was always independent, Miss Luttrell, and beholden to
      neither Luttrells nor Modburies, and that I tell &lsquo;ee to your face,
      ma&rsquo;am, and no shame of it either.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, well, Mrs. Oswald,&rsquo; said the old lady, shaking her head more
      violently than ever at this direct discomfiture, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      to argue with you about the matter. I dare say your son&rsquo;s a very
      worthy young man, and has worked his way up into a position he wasn&rsquo;t
      intended for by Providence. But it&rsquo;s no business of mine, thank
      heaven, it&rsquo;s no business of mine, for I&rsquo;m not responsible for
      all the vagaries of all the tradespeople on my brother&rsquo;s estate, nor
      don&rsquo;t want to be. There&rsquo;s Mrs. Figgins, now, the baker&rsquo;s
      wife; her daughter has just chosen to get married to a bank clerk in
      London; and I said to her this morning, &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Figgins, so you&rsquo;ve
      let your Polly go and pick up with some young fellow from town that you&rsquo;ve
      never seen before, haven&rsquo;t you? And that&rsquo;s the way of all you
      people. You marry your girls to bank clerks without a reference, for the
      sake of getting &lsquo;em off your hands, and what&rsquo;s the
      consequence? They rob their employers to keep up a pretty household for
      their wives, as if they were fine ladies; and then at last the thing&rsquo;s
      discovered, there comes a smash, they run away to America, and you have
      your daughters and their children thrown back again penniless upon your
      hands.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I said to her, Mrs. Oswald. And how&rsquo;s
      YOUR daughter, by the way&mdash;Jemima I think you call her; how&rsquo;s
      she, eh, tell me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon, Miss Luttrell, but her name&rsquo;s not Jemima; it&rsquo;s
      Edith.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Edith, is it? Well to be sure! The grand names girls have dangling
      about with them nowadays! My name&rsquo;s plain Catherine, and it&rsquo;s
      good enough for me, thank goodness. But these young ladies of the new
      style must be Ediths and Eleanors and Ophelias, and all that heathenish
      kind of thing, as if they were princesses of the blood or play-actresses,
      instead of being good Christian Susans and Janes and Betties, like their
      grandmothers were before them. And Miss Edith, now, what is SHE doing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She&rsquo;s doing nothing in particular at this moment, Miss Luttrell,
      leastways not so far as I know of; but she&rsquo;s going up to Oxford part
      of this term on a visit to her brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Going up to Oxford, my good woman! Why, heaven bless the girl, she&rsquo;d
      much better stop at home and learn her catechism. She should try to do her
      duty in that station of life to which it has pleased Providence to call
      her, instead of running after young gentlemen above her own rank and place
      in society at Oxford. Tell her so from me, Mrs. Oswald, and mind you don&rsquo;t
      send the tea dusty. Two pounds of your best, if you please, as soon as you
      can send it. Good-morning.&rsquo; And Miss Luttrell, having discovered the
      absolute truth of the shocking rumour which had reached her about Edith&rsquo;s
      projected visit, the confirmation of which was the sole object of her
      colloquy, wagged her way out of the shop again successfully, and was duly
      assisted by the page-boy into her shambling little palsied donkey-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That was all the old cat came about, you warr&rsquo;nt you,&rsquo;
      muttered Mr. Oswald himself from behind his biscuit-boxes. &lsquo;Must
      have heard it from the Rector&rsquo;s wife, and wanted to find out if it
      was true, to go and tell Mrs. Walters o&rsquo; such a bit o&rsquo; turble
      presumptiousness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the little study with the bow-window over the shop, Harry
      and Edie Oswald were busily discussing the necessary preparations for Edie&rsquo;s
      long-promised visit to the University.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope you&rsquo;ve got everything nice in the way of dress, you know,
      Edie,&rsquo; said Harry. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll want a decent dinner dress,
      of course, for you&rsquo;ll be asked out to dine at least once or twice;
      and I want you to have everything exceedingly proper and pretty.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think I&rsquo;ve got all I need in that way, Harry; I&rsquo;ve my dark
      poplin, cut square in the bodice, for one dinner dress, and my high black
      silk to fall back upon for another. Worn open in front, with a lace
      handkerchief and a locket, it does really very nicely. Then I&rsquo;ve got
      three afternoon dresses, the grey you gave me, the sage-greeny aesthetic
      one, and the peacock-blue with the satin box-pleats. It&rsquo;s a charming
      dress, the peacock-blue; it looks as if it might have stepped straight out
      of a genuine Titian. It came home from Miss Wells&rsquo;s this morning.
      Wait five minutes, like a dear boy, and I&rsquo;ll run and put it on and
      let you see me in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That&rsquo;s a good girl, do. I&rsquo;m so anxious you should have all
      your clothes the exact pink of perfection, Popsy. Though I&rsquo;m afraid
      I&rsquo;m a very poor critic in that matter&mdash;if you were only a
      problem in space of four dimensions, now! Yet, after all, every man or
      woman is more of a problem than anything in x square plus y square you can
      possibly set yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie ran lightly up into her own room, and soon reappeared clad
      resplendent in the new peacock-blue dress, with hat and parasol to match,
      and a little creamy lamb&rsquo;s-wool scarf thrown with artful
      carelessness around her pretty neck and shoulders. Harry looked at her
      with unfeigned admiration. Indeed, you would not easily find many lighter
      or more fairly-like little girls than Edie Oswald, even in the beautiful
      half-Celtic South Hams of Devon. In figure she was rather small than
      short, for though she was but a wee thing, her form was so exactly and
      delicately modelled that she might have looked tall if she stood alone at
      a little distance. She never walked, but seemed to dance about from place
      to place, so buoyant and light, that Harry doubted whether in her case
      gravitation could really vary as the square of the distance&mdash;it
      seemed, in fact, to be almost diminished in the proportions of the cube.
      Her hair and eyes&mdash;such big bright eyes!&mdash;were dark; but her
      complexion was scarcely brunette, and the colour in her cheeks was rich
      and peach-like, after the true Devonian type. She was dimpled whenever she
      smiled, and she smiled often; her full lips giving a peculiar ripe look to
      her laughing mouth that suited admirably with her light and delicate style
      of beauty. Perhaps some people might have thought them too full; certainly
      they irresistibly suggested to a critical eye the distinct notion of
      kissability. As she stood there, faintly blushing, waiting to be admired
      by her brother, in her neatly fitting dainty blue dress, her lips half
      parted, and her arms held carelessly at her side, she looked about as much
      like a fairy picture as it is given to mere human flesh and blood to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s delicious, Edie,&rsquo; said Harry, surveying her from, head
      to foot with a smile of satisfaction which made her blush deepen; ‘it&rsquo;s
      simply delicious. Where on earth did you get the idea of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, it&rsquo;s partly the present style,&rsquo; said Edie; &lsquo;but I
      took the notion of the bodice partly too from that Vandyck, you know, in
      the Palazzo Bossi at Genoa.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I remember, I remember,&rsquo; Harry answered, contemplating her with an
      admiring eye. &lsquo;Now just turn round and show me how it sits behind,
      Edie. You recollect Théophile Gautier says the one great advantage which a
      beautiful woman possesses over a beautiful statue is this, that while a
      man has to walk round the beautiful statue in order to see it from every
      side, he can ask the beautiful woman to turn herself round and let him see
      her, without requiring to take that trouble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Théophile Gautier was a horrid man, and if anybody but my brother quoted
      such a thing as that to me I should be very angry with him indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Théophile Gautier was quite as horrid as you consider him to be, and if
      you were anybody but my sister it isn&rsquo;t probable I should have
      quoted him to you. But if there is any statue on earth prettier or more
      graceful than you are in that dress at this moment, Edie, then the Venus
      of Milo ought immediately to be pulverised to ultimate atoms for a rank
      artistic impostor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, Harry, for the compliment. What pretty things you must be
      capable of saying to somebody else&rsquo;s sister, when you&rsquo;re so
      polite and courtly to your own.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘On the contrary, Popsy, when it comes to somebody else&rsquo;s sister I&rsquo;m
      much too nervous and funky to say anything of the kind. But you must at
      least do Gautier the justice to observe that if I had described a circle
      round you, instead of allowing you to revolve once on your own axis, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get the gloss on the satin in the
      sunlight as I do now that you turn the panniers toward the window. That,
      you must admit, is a very important aesthetic consideration.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, of course it&rsquo;s essentially a sunshiny dress,&rsquo; said Edie,
      smiling. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s meant to be worn out of doors, on a fine
      afternoon, when the light is falling slantwise, you know, just as it does
      now through the low window. That&rsquo;s the light painters always choose
      for doing satin in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s certainly very pretty,&rsquo; Harry went on, musing; &lsquo;but
      I&rsquo;m afraid Le Breton would say it was a serious piece of economic
      hubris.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Piece of what?&rsquo; asked Edie quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Piece of hubris&mdash;an economical outrage, don&rsquo;t you see; a gross
      anti-social and individualist demonstration. Hubris, you know, is Greek
      for insolence; at least, not quite insolence, but a sort of pride and
      overweening rebelliousness against the gods, the kind of arrogance that
      brings Nemesis after it, you understand. It was hubris in Agamemnon and
      Xerxes to go swelling about and ruffling themselves like turkey-cocks,
      because they were great conquerors and all that sort of thing; and it was
      their Nemesis to get murdered by Clytemnestra, or jolly well beaten by the
      Athenians at Salamis. Well, Le Breton always uses the word for anything
      that he thinks socially wrong&mdash;and he thinks a good many things
      socially wrong, I can tell you&mdash;anything that partakes of the nature
      of a class distinction, or a mere vulgar ostentation of wealth, or a
      useless waste of good, serviceable, labour-gotten material. He would call
      it hubris to have silver spoons when electroplate would do just as well;
      or to keep a valet for your own personal attendant, making one man into
      the mere bodily appanage of another; or to buy anything you didn&rsquo;t
      really need, causing somebody else to do work for you which might
      otherwise have been avoided.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Which Mr. Le Breton&mdash;the elder or the younger one?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, the younger&mdash;Ernest. As for Herbert, the Fellow of St. Aldate&rsquo;s,
      he&rsquo;s not troubled with any such scruples; he takes the world as he
      finds it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They&rsquo;ve both gone in for their degrees, haven&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Herbert has got a fellowship; Ernest&rsquo;s up in residence still
      looking about for one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s Ernest that would think my dress a piece of
      what-you-may-call-it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Ernest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then I&rsquo;m sure I shan&rsquo;t like him. I should insist upon every
      woman&rsquo;s natural right to wear the dress or hat or bonnet that suits
      her complexion best.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You can&rsquo;t tell, Edie, till you&rsquo;ve met him. He&rsquo;s a very
      good fellow; and of one thing I&rsquo;m certain, whatever he thinks right
      he does, and sticks to it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But do YOU think, Harry, I oughtn&rsquo;t to wear a new peacock-blue
      camel-hair dress on my first visit up to Oxford?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Edie dear, I don&rsquo;t quite know what my own opinions are
      exactly upon that matter. I&rsquo;m not an economist, you see, I&rsquo;m a
      man of science. When I look at you, standing there so pretty in that
      pretty dress, I feel inclined to say to myself, &ldquo;Every woman ought
      to do her best to make herself look as beautiful as she can for the common
      delectation of all humanity.&rdquo; Your beauty, a Greek would have said,
      is a gift from the gods to us all, and we ought all gratefully to make the
      most of it. I&rsquo;m sure <i>I</i> do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, Harry, again. You&rsquo;re in your politest humour this
      afternoon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But then, on the other hand, I know if Le Breton were here he&rsquo;d
      soon argue me over to the other side. He has the enthusiasm of humanity so
      strong upon him that you can&rsquo;t help agreeing with him as long as he&rsquo;s
      talking to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then if he were here you&rsquo;d probably make me put away the
      peacock-blue, for fear of hubris and Nemesis and so forth, and go up to
      Oxford a perfect fright in my shabby old Indian tussore!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t know that I should do that, even then, Edie. In the first
      place, nothing on earth could make you look a perfect fright, or anything
      like one, Popsy dear; and in the second place, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m
      Socialist enough myself ever to have the courage of my opinions as Le
      Breton has. Certainly, I should never attempt to force them unwillingly
      upon others. You must remember, Edie, it&rsquo;s one thing for Le Breton
      to be so communistic as all that comes to, and quite another thing for you
      and me. Le Breton&rsquo;s father was a general and a knight, you see; and
      people will never forget that his mother&rsquo;s Lady Le Breton still,
      whatever he does. He may do what he likes in the way of social
      eccentricities, and the world will only say he&rsquo;s such a very strange
      advanced young fellow. But if I were to take you up to Oxford badly
      dressed, or out of the fashion, or looking peculiar in any way, the world
      wouldn&rsquo;t put it down to our political beliefs, but would say we were
      mere country tradespeople by birth, and didn&rsquo;t know any better. That
      makes a lot of difference, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re quite right, Harry; and yet, do you know, I think there must
      be something, too, in sticking to one&rsquo;s own opinions, like Mr. Le
      Breton. I should stick to mine, I&rsquo;m sure, and wear whatever dress I
      liked, in spite of anybody. It&rsquo;s a sweet thing, really, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo; And she turned herself round, craning over her shoulder to look
      at the effect, in a vain attempt to assume an objective attitude towards
      her own back.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m going to Oxford at last, Harry,&rsquo; she said,
      after a short pause. &lsquo;I HAVE so longed to go all these years while
      you were an undergraduate; and I&rsquo;m dying to have got there, now the
      chance has really come at last, after all. I shall glory in the place, I&rsquo;m
      certain; and it&rsquo;ll be so nice to make the acquaintance of all your
      clever friends.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Edie,&rsquo; said her brother, smiling gently at the light, joyous,
      tremulous little figure, &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ve done right in putting
      it off till now. It&rsquo;s just as well you haven&rsquo;t gone up to
      Oxford till after your trip on the Continent with me. That three months in
      Paris, and Switzerland, and Venice, and Florence, did you a lot of good,
      you see; improved you, and gave you tone, and supplied you with things to
      talk about.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, you oughtn&rsquo;t to think I needed any improvement at all, sir,&rsquo;
      Edie answered, pouting; &lsquo;and as to talking, I&rsquo;m not aware I
      had ever any dearth of subjects for conversation even before I went on the
      Continent. There are things enough to be said about heaven and earth in
      England, surely, without one having to hurry through France and Italy,
      like Cook&rsquo;s excursionists, just to hunt up something fresh to
      chatter about. It&rsquo;s my belief that a person who can&rsquo;t find
      anything new to say about the every-day world around her won&rsquo;t
      discover much suggestive matter for conversation in a Continental
      Bradshaw. It&rsquo;s like that feeble watery lady I met at the table d&rsquo;hote
      at Geneva. From something she said I gathered she&rsquo;d been in India,
      and I asked her how she liked it. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      very hot.&rdquo; I told her I had heard so before. Presently she said
      something casually about having been in Brazil. I asked her what sort of
      place Brazil was. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dreadfully
      hot.&rdquo; I told her I&rsquo;d heard that too. By-and-by she began to
      talk again about Barbadoes. &ldquo;What did you think of the West Indies?&rdquo;
      I said. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re terribly hot,
      really.&rdquo; I told her I had gathered as much from previous travellers.
      And that was positively all in the end I ever got out of her, for all her
      travels.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Edie, I&rsquo;ve always admitted that you were simply perfect,&rsquo;
      Harry said, glancing at her with visible admiration, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t
      think anything on earth could possibly improve you&mdash;except perhaps a
      judicious course of differential and integral calculus, which might
      possibly serve to tone down slightly your exuberant and excessive
      vitality. Still, you know, from the point of view of society, which is a
      force we have always to reckon with&mdash;a constant, in fact, that we may
      call Pi&mdash;there can be no doubt in the world that to have been on the
      Continent is a differentiating factor in one&rsquo;s social position. It
      doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least what your own private evaluation of Pi
      may be; if you don&rsquo;t happen to know the particular things and places
      that Pi knows, Pi&rsquo;s evaluation of you will be approximately a
      minimum, of that you may be certain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, for my part, I don&rsquo;t care twopence about Pi as you call it,&rsquo;
      said Edie, tossing her pretty little head contemptuously; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m
      very glad indeed to have been on the Continent for my own sake, because of
      the pictures, and palaces, and mountains, and waterfalls we&rsquo;ve seen,
      and not because of Pi&rsquo;s opinion of me for having seen them. I would
      have been the same person really whether I&rsquo;d seen them or not; but I&rsquo;m
      so much the richer myself for that view from the top of the Col de Balme,
      and for that Murillo&mdash;oh, do you remember the flood of light on that
      Murillo?&mdash;in the far corner of that delicious gallery at Bologna.
      Why, mother darling, what on earth has been vexing you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing at all, Edie dear; leastways, that is, nothing to speak of,&rsquo;
      said her mother, coming up from the shop hot and flurried from her
      desperate encounter with the redoubtable Miss Luttrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, I know just what it is, darling,&rsquo; cried the girl, putting her
      arm around her mother&rsquo;s waist caressingly, and drawing her down to
      kiss her face half a dozen times over in her outburst of sympathy. ‘That
      horrid old Miss Catherine has been here again, I&rsquo;m sure, for I saw
      her going out of the shop just now, and she&rsquo;s been saying something
      or other spiteful, as she always does, to vex my dearie. What did she say
      to you to-day, now do tell us, duckie mother?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, there,&rsquo; said Mrs. Oswald, half laughing and half crying,
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell &lsquo;ee exactly what she did say, but it was
      just the kind of thing that she mostly does, impudent like, just to hurt a
      body&rsquo;s feelings. She said you&rsquo;d better not go to Oxford, Edie,
      but stop at home and learn your catechism.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You might have pointed out to her, mother dear,&rsquo; said the young
      man, smoothing her hair softly with his hand, and kissing her forehead,
      &lsquo;that in the most advanced intellectual centres the Church catechism
      is perhaps no longer regarded as the absolute ultimatum of the highest and
      deepest economical wisdom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bless your heart, Harry, what&rsquo;d be the good of talking that way to
      the likes of she? She wouldn&rsquo;t understand a single word of what you
      were driving at. It must be all plain sailing with her, without it&rsquo;s
      in the way of spite, and then she sees her chance to tack round the
      hardest corner with half a wind in her sails only, as soon as look at it.
      Her sharpness goes all off toward ill-nature, that it do. Why, she said
      you&rsquo;d got on at Oxford by good patronage!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, you see, Edie,&rsquo; cried Harry demonstratively, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      an infinitesimal fraction of Pi; that&rsquo;s a minute decimal of this
      great, sneering, ugly aggregate &ldquo;society&rdquo; that we have to deal
      with whether we will or no, and that rends us and grinds us to powder if
      only it can once get in the thin end of a chance. Take shaky bitter old
      Miss Catherine for your unit, multiply her to the nth, and there you see
      the irreducible power we have to fight against. All one&rsquo;s political
      economy is very well in its way; but the practical master of the situation
      is Pi, sitting autocratically in many-headed judgment on our poor solitary
      little individualities, and crushing us irretrievably with the dead weight
      of its inexorable cumulative nothingness. And to think that that quivering
      old mass of perambulating jealousy&mdash;that living incarnation of envy,
      hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness&mdash;should be able to make you
      uncomfortable for a single moment, mother darling, with her petty,
      dribbling, doddering venom, why, it&rsquo;s simply unendurable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There now, Harry,&rsquo; said Mrs. Oswald, relenting, &lsquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
      be too hard, neither, on poor old Miss Catherine. She&rsquo;s a bit
      soured, you see, by disappointments and one thing and another. She doesn&rsquo;t
      mean it, really, but it&rsquo;s just her nature. Folks can&rsquo;t be
      blamed for their nature, now, can they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It occurs to me,&rsquo; said Harry quietly, &lsquo;that vipers only sting
      because it&rsquo;s their nature; and Dr. Watts has made a similar
      observation with regard to the growling and fighting of bears and lions.
      But I&rsquo;m not aware that anybody has yet proposed to get up a Society
      for the protection of those much-misunderstood creatures, on the ground
      that they are not really responsible for their own inherited dispositions.
      Mr. William Sikes had a nature (no doubt congenital) which impelled him to
      beat his wife&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure that she was even his wife at all,
      now I come to think of it, but that&rsquo;s a mere detail&mdash;and to
      kick his familiar acquaintances casually about the head. We, on the other
      hand, have natures which impel us, when we catch Mr. William Sikes
      indulging in these innate idiosyncrasies by way of recreation, to clap him
      promptly into prison, and even, under certain aggravating conditions, to
      cause him to be hanged by the neck till he be dead. This may be a
      regrettable incident of our own peculiar dispositions, mother dear, but it
      has at least the same justification as Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s or the bears&rsquo;
      and lions&rsquo;, that &lsquo;tis our nature to. And I feel pretty much
      the same way about old Miss Luttrell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, there,&rsquo; said his mother, kissing him gently, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
      a bad rebellious boy to be calling names, like a chatter-mag, and I won&rsquo;t
      listen to you any longer. How pretty Edie do look in her new dress, to be
      sure, Harry. I&rsquo;ll warr&rsquo;nt there won&rsquo;t be a prettier girl
      in Oxford next week than what she is; no, nor a better one and a sweeter
      one neither.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry put his arms round both their waists at once, with an affectionate
      pressure; and they went down to their old-fashioned tea together in the
      little parlour behind the shop, looking out over the garden, and the
      beach, and the great cliffs beyond on either hand, to the very farthest
      edge of the distant clear-cut blue horizon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. &mdash; MAGDALEN QUAD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Reverend Arthur Collingham Berkeley, curate of St. Fredegond&rsquo;s,
      lounged lazily in his own neatly padded wickerwork easy-chair, opposite
      the large lattice-paned windows of his pretty little first-floor rooms in
      the front quad of Magdalen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There&rsquo;s a great deal to be said, Le Breton, in favour of October
      term,&rsquo; he observed, in his soft, musical voice, as he gazed
      pensively across the central grass-plot to the crimson drapery of the
      Founder&rsquo;s Tower. &lsquo;Just look at that magnificent Virginia
      creeper over there, now; just look at the way the red on it melts
      imperceptibly into Tyrian purple and cloth of gold! Isn&rsquo;t that in
      itself argument enough to fling at Hartmann&rsquo;s head, if he ventured
      to come here sprinkling about his heresies, with his affected little
      spray-shooter, in the midst of a drowsy Oxford autumn? The Cardinal never
      saw Virginia creeper, I suppose; a man of his taste wouldn&rsquo;t have
      been guilty of committing such a gross practical anachronism as that, any
      more than he would have smoked a cigarette before tobacco was invented;
      but if only he could have seen the October effect on that tower yonder, he&rsquo;d
      have acknowledged that his own hat and robe were positively nowhere in the
      running, for colour, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,&rsquo; answered Herbert, putting down the Venetian glass goblet he
      had been examining closely with due care into its niche in the
      over-mantel, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt Wolsey had too much historical
      sense ever to step entirely out of his own century, like my brother
      Ernest, for instance; but I&rsquo;ve never heard his opinion on the
      subject of colour-harmonies, and I should suspect it of having been
      distinctly tinged with nascent symptoms of renaissance vulgarity. This is
      a lovely bit of Venetian, really, Berkeley. How the dickens do you manage
      to pick up all these pretty things, I wonder? Why can&rsquo;t I afford
      them, now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What a question for the endowed and established to put to a poor starving
      devil of a curate like me!&rsquo; said Berkeley lightly. &lsquo;You, an
      incarnate sinecure and vested interest, a creature revelling in an
      unearned income of fabulous Oriental magnificence&mdash;I dare say,
      putting one thing with another, fully as much as five hundred a year&mdash;to
      ask me, the unbeneficed and insignificant, with my wretched pittance of
      eighty pounds per annum and my three pass-men a term for classical mods,
      how I scrape together the few miserable, hoarded ha&rsquo;pence which I
      grudgingly invest in my pots and pipkins! I save them from my dinner, Mr.
      Bursar&mdash;I save them. If the Church only recognised modest merit as it
      ought to do!&mdash;if the bishops only listened with due attention to the
      sound and scholarly exegesis of my Sunday evening discourses at St.
      Fredegond&rsquo;s!&mdash;then, indeed, I might be disposed to regard
      things through a more satisfied medium&mdash;the medium of a nice, fat,
      juicy country living. But for you, Le Breton&mdash;you, sir, a pluralist
      and a sanguisorb of the deepest dye&mdash;to reproach me with my
      Franciscan poverty&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s too cruel!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m an abuse, I know,&rsquo; Herbert answered, smiling and waving
      his hand gracefully. &lsquo;I at once admit it. Abuses exist, unhappily;
      and while they continue do so, isn&rsquo;t it better they should envisage
      themselves as me than as some other and probably less deserving fellow?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, it&rsquo;s not, decidedly. I should much prefer that one of them
      envisaged itself as me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, of course. From your own strictly subjective point of view that&rsquo;s
      very natural. I also look at the question abstractly from the side of the
      empirical ego, and correctly deduce a corresponding conclusion. Only then,
      you see, the terms of the minor premiss are luckily reversed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said the curate, &lsquo;the fact about the
      tea-things is this. You eat up your income, devour your substance in
      riotous living; I prefer to feast my eyes and ears to my grosser senses.
      You dine at high table, and fare sumptuously every day; I take a commons
      of cold beef for lunch, and have tea off an egg and roll in my own rooms
      at seven. You drink St. Emilion or still hock; I drink water from the well
      or the cup that cheers but not obfuscates. The difference goes to pay for
      the crockery. Do likewise, and with your untold wealth you might play Aunt
      Sally at Oriental blue, and take cock-shots with a boot-jack at
      hawthorn-pattern vases.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘At any rate, Berkeley, you always manage to get your money&rsquo;s worth
      of amusement out of your money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course, because I lay myself out to do it. Buy a bottle of champagne,
      drink it off, and there you have to show for your total permanent
      investment on the transaction the memory of a noisy evening and a headache
      the next morning. Buy a flute, or a book of poems, or a little picture, or
      a Palissy platter, and you have something to turn to with delight and
      admiration for half a lifetime.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, but it isn&rsquo;t everybody who can isolate himself so utterly from
      the workaday world and live so completely in his own little paradise of
      art as you can, my dear fellow. Non omnia possumus omnes. You seem to be
      always up in the aesthetic clouds, with your own music automatically laid
      on, and no need of cherubim or seraphim to chant continually for your
      gratification. Play me something of your own on your flute now, like a
      good fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, I won&rsquo;t; because the spirit doesn&rsquo;t move me. It&rsquo;s
      treachery to the divine gift to play when you don&rsquo;t want to.
      Besides, what&rsquo;s the use of playing before YOU when you&rsquo;re not
      the dean of a musical cathedral? David was wiser; he played only before
      Saul, who had of course all the livings in his own gift, no doubt. I&rsquo;ve
      got a new thing running in my head this very minute that you shall hear
      though, all the same, as soon as I&rsquo;ve hammered it into shape&mdash;a
      sort of villanette in music, a little whiff of country freshness,
      suggested by the new ethereal acquisition, little Miss Butterfly. Have you
      seen Miss Butterfly yet?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not by that name, at any rate. Who is she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, the name&rsquo;s my own invention. Mademoiselle Volauvent, I mean&mdash;the
      little bit of whirligig thistledown from Devonshire, Oswald&rsquo;s
      sister, you know, of Oriel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, that one! Yes; just caught a glimpse of her in the High on Thursday.
      Very pretty, certainly, and as airy as a humming-bird.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That&rsquo;s her! She&rsquo;s coming here to lunch this morning. If you&rsquo;re
      a good boy, and will promise not to say anything naughty, you may stop and
      meet her. She&rsquo;s a nice little thing, but rather timid at seeing so
      many fresh faces. You mustn&rsquo;t frighten her by discussing the
      Absolute and the Unconditioned, or bore her by talking about Aristotle&rsquo;s
      Politics, or the revolutions in Corcyra. For you know, my dear Le Breton,
      if you HAVE a fault, it is that you&rsquo;re such a consummate and
      irrepressible prig; now aren&rsquo;t you really?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m hardly a fair judge on that subject, I suppose, Berkeley; but
      if YOU have a rudimentary glimmering of a virtue, it is that you&rsquo;re
      such a deliciously frank and yet considerate critic. I&rsquo;ll pocket
      your rudeness though, and eat your lunch, in spite of it. Is Miss
      Butterfly, as you call her, as stand-off as her brother?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all. She&rsquo;s accueillante to the last degree.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very restricted, I suppose&mdash;a country girl of the first water?
      Horizon absolutely bounded by the high hedges of her native parish?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh dear no! Anything but that. She&rsquo;s like her brother, naturally
      quick and adaptive.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oswald&rsquo;s an excellent fellow in his way,&rsquo; said Herbert,
      button-holing his own waistcoat; &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s spoilt by two bad
      traits. In the first place, he&rsquo;s so dreadfully conscious of the fact
      that he has risen from a lower position; and then, again, he&rsquo;s so
      engrossingly and pervadingly mathematical. X square seems to have seized
      upon him bodily, and to have wormed its fatal way into his very marrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, you must remember, he&rsquo;s true to his first love. Culture came to
      him first, while yet he abode in Philistia, under the playful disguise of
      a conic section. He scaled his way out of Gath by means of a treatise on
      elementary trigonometry, and evaded Askelon on the wings of an undulatory
      theory of light. It is different with us, you know, who have emerged from
      the land of darkness by the regular classical and literary highway. We
      feed upon Rabelais and Burton; he flits carelessly from flower to flower
      of the theory of Quantics. If he were an idealist painter, like Rossetti,
      he would paint great allegorical pictures for us, representing an
      asymptotic curve appearing to him in a dream, and introducing that
      blushing maiden, Hyperbola, to his affectionate consideration.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Berkeley spoke, a rap sounded on the oak, and Ernest Le Breton entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What, you here, Herbert?&rsquo; he said with a shade of displeasure in
      his tone. &lsquo;Are you, too, of the bidden?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Berkeley has asked me to stop and lunch with him, if that&rsquo;s what
      you mean.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We shall be quite a party,&rsquo; said Ernest, seating himself, and
      looking abstractedly round the room. &lsquo;Why, Berkeley,&rsquo; as his
      eye fell upon the Venetian vase, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve positively got some
      more gew-gaws here. This one&rsquo;s new, isn&rsquo;t it? Eh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. I picked it up for a song, this long, at a stranded village in the
      Apennines. Literally for a song, for it cost me just what I got from
      Fradelli for that last little piece of mine. It&rsquo;s very pretty, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very; exquisite, really; the blending of the tones is so perfect. I wish
      I knew what to think about these things. I can&rsquo;t make up my mind
      about them. Sometimes I think it&rsquo;s all right to make them and buy
      them; sometimes I think it&rsquo;s all wrong.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, if that&rsquo;s your difficulty,&rsquo; said Berkeley, pulling his
      white tie straight at the tiny round looking-glass, &lsquo;I can easily
      reassure you. Do you think a hundred and eighty pounds a year an excessive
      sum for one person to spend upon his own entire living?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It doesn&rsquo;t seem so, as expenses go amongst US,&rsquo; said Ernest,
      seriously, ‘though I dare say it would look like shocking extravagance to
      a working man with a wife and family.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very well, that&rsquo;s the very outside I ever spend upon myself in any
      one year, for the excellent reason that it&rsquo;s all I ever get to spend
      in any way. Now, why shouldn&rsquo;t I spend it on the things that please
      me best and are joys for ever, instead of on the things that disappear at
      once and perish in the using?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, but that&rsquo;s not the whole question,&rsquo; Ernest answered,
      looking at the curate fixedly. &lsquo;What right have you and I to spend
      so much when others are wanting for bread? And what right have you or I to
      make other people work at producing these useless trinkets for our sole
      selfish gratification?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well now, Le Breton,&rsquo; said the parson, assuming a more serious
      tone, ‘you know you&rsquo;re a reasonable creature, so I don&rsquo;t mind
      discussing this question with you. You&rsquo;ve got an ethical foundation
      to your nature, and you want to see things done on decent grounds of
      distributive justice. There I am one with you. But you&rsquo;ve also got
      an aesthetic side to your nature, which makes you worth arguing with upon
      the matter. I won&rsquo;t argue with your vulgar materialised socialist,
      who would break up the frieze of the Parthenon for road metal, or pull
      down Giotto&rsquo;s frescoes because they represent scenes in the fabulous
      lives of saints and martyrs. You know what a work of art is when you see
      it; and therefore you&rsquo;re worth arguing with, which your vulgar
      Continental socialist really isn&rsquo;t. The one cogent argument for him
      is the whiff of grape-shot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I recognise,&rsquo; said Ernest, &lsquo;that the works of art, of poetry,
      or of music, which we possess are a grand inheritance from the past; and I
      would do all I could to preserve them intact for those that come after us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m sure you would. No restoration or tinkering in you, I&rsquo;m
      certain. Well, then, would you give anything for a world which hadn&rsquo;t
      got this aesthetic side to its corporate existence? Would you give
      anything for a world which didn&rsquo;t care at all for painting,
      sculpture, music, poetry? I wouldn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want such a
      world. I won&rsquo;t countenance such a world. I&rsquo;ll do nothing to
      further or advance such a world. It&rsquo;s utterly repugnant to me, and I
      banish it, as Themistocles banished the Athenians.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But consider,&rsquo; said Ernest, &lsquo;we live in a world where men and
      women are actually starving. How can we reconcile to our consciences the
      spending of one penny on one useless thing when others are dying of sheer
      want, and cold, and nakedness? That&rsquo;s the great question that&rsquo;s
      always oppressing my poor dissatisfied conscience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So it does everybody&rsquo;s&mdash;except Herbert&rsquo;s: he explains it
      all on biological grounds as the beautiful discriminative action of
      natural selection. Simple, but not consolatory. Still, look at the other
      side of the question. Suppose you and everybody else were to give up all
      superfluities, and confine all your energies to the unlimited production
      of bare necessaries. Suppose you occupy every acre of land with your
      corn-fields, or your piggeries; and sweep away all the parks, and woods,
      and heaths, and moorlands in England. Suppose you keep on letting your
      population multiply as fast as it chooses&mdash;and it WILL multiply, you
      know, in that ugly, reckless, anti-Malthusian fashion of its own&mdash;till
      every rood of ground maintains its man, and only just maintains him; and
      what will you have got then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A dead level of abject pauperism,&rsquo; put in Herbert blandly; &lsquo;a
      reductio ad absurdum of all your visionary Schurzian philosophy, my dear
      Ernest. Look at it another way, now, and just consider. Which really and
      truly matters most to you and me, a great work of art or a highly
      respectable horny-handed son of toil, whose acquaintance we have never had
      the pleasure of personally making? Suppose you read in the Times that the
      respectable horny-handed one has fallen off a scaffolding and broken his
      neck; and that the Dresden Madonna has been burnt by an unexpected
      accident; which of the two items of intelligence affects you the most
      acutely? My dear fellow, you may push your humanitarian enthusiasm as far
      as ever you like; but in your heart of hearts you know as well as I do
      that you&rsquo;ll deeply regret the loss of the Madonna, and you&rsquo;ll
      never think again about the fate of the respectable horny-handed, his wife
      or children.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest&rsquo;s answer, if he had any to make, was effectually nipped in
      the bud by the entrance of the scout, who came in to announce Mr. and Miss
      Oswald and Mrs. Martindale. Edie wore the grey dress, her brother&rsquo;s
      present, and flitted into the room after her joyous fashion, full of her
      first fresh delight at the cloistered quad of Magdalen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What a delicious college, Mr. Berkeley!&rsquo; she said, holding out her
      hand to him brightly. &lsquo;Good-morning, Mr. Le Breton; this is your
      brother, I know by the likeness. I thought New College very beautiful, but
      nothing I&rsquo;ve seen is quite as beautiful as Magdalen. What a
      privilege to live always in such a place! And what an exquisite view from
      your window here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,&rsquo; said Berkeley, moving a few music-books from the seat in the
      window-sill; &lsquo;come and sit by it, Miss Oswald. Mrs. Martindale, won&rsquo;t
      you put your shawl down? How&rsquo;s the Professor to-day? So sorry he
      couldn&rsquo;t come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, he had to go to sit on one of his Boards,&rsquo; said the old lady,
      seating herself. &lsquo;But you know I&rsquo;m quite accustomed to going
      out without him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Berkeley knew as much; indeed, being a person of minute strategical
      intellect, he had purposely looked out a day on which the Professor had to
      attend a meeting of the delegates of something or other, so as to secure
      Mrs. Martindale&rsquo;s services without the supplementary drawback of
      that prodigious bore. Not that he was particularly anxious for Mrs.
      Martindale&rsquo;s own society, which was of the most strictly negative
      character; but he didn&rsquo;t wish Edie to be the one lady in a party of
      four men, and he invited the Professor&rsquo;s wife as an excellent
      neutral figure-head, to keep her in countenance. Ladies were scarcer then
      in Oxford than they are nowadays. The married fellow was still a tentative
      problematical experiment in those years, and the invasion of the Parks by
      young couples had hardly yet begun in earnest. So female society was still
      at a considerable local premium, and Berkeley was glad enough to secure
      even colourless old Mrs. Martindale to square his party at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And how do you like Oxford, Miss Oswald?&rsquo; asked Ernest, making his
      way towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Le Breton, what a question to put to her!&rsquo; said Berkeley,
      smiling. &lsquo;As if Oxford were a place to be appraised offhand, on
      three days&rsquo; acquaintance. You remind me of the American who went to
      look at Niagara, and made an approving note in his memorandum book to say
      that he found it really a very elegant cataract.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, but you MUST form some opinion of it at least, at first sight,&rsquo;
      cried Edie; &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t help having an impression of a place
      from the first moment, even if you haven&rsquo;t a judgment on it, can you
      now? I think it really surpasses my expectations, Mr. Le Breton, which is
      always a pleasant surprise. Venice fell below them; Florence just came up
      to them; but Oxford, I think, really surpasses them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We have three beautiful towns in Britain,&rsquo; Berkeley said. (&lsquo;As
      if he were a Welsh Triad,&rsquo; suggested Herbert Le Breton,
      parenthetically.) ‘Torquay, Oxford, Edinburgh. Torquay is all nature,
      spoilt by what I won&rsquo;t call art; Oxford is all art, superimposed on
      a swamp that I won&rsquo;t call nature; Edinburgh is both nature and art,
      working pretty harmoniously together, to make up a unique and exquisite
      picture.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Just like Naples, Venice, and Heidelberg,&rsquo; said Edie, half to
      herself; but Berkeley caught at the words quickly as she said them. ‘Yes,&rsquo;
      he answered; &lsquo;a very good parallel, only Oxford has a trifle more
      nature about it than Venice. The lagoon, without the palaces, would be
      simply hideous; the Oseney flats, without the colleges, would be nothing
      worse than merely dull.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We owe a great deal,&rsquo; said Ernest, gazing out towards the
      quadrangle, ‘to the forgotten mass of labouring humanity who piled all
      those blocks of shapeless stone into beautiful forms for us who come after
      to admire and worship. I often wonder, when I sit here in Berkeley&rsquo;s
      window-seat, and look across the quad to the carved pinnacles on the
      Founder&rsquo;s Tower there, whether any of us can ever hope to leave
      behind to our successors any legacy at all comparable to the one left us
      by those nameless old mediaeval masons. It&rsquo;s a very saddening
      thought that we for whom all these beautiful things have been put together&mdash;we
      whom labouring humanity has pampered and petted from our cradles upward,
      feeding us on its whitest bread, and toiling for us with all its weary
      sinews&mdash;that we probably will never do anything at all for it and for
      the world in return, but will simply eat our way through life aimlessly,
      and die forgotten in the end like the beasts that perish. It ought to make
      us, as a class, terribly ashamed of our own utter and abject inutility.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie looked at him with a sort of hushed surprise; she was accustomed to
      hear Harry talk radical talk enough after his own fashion, but radicalism
      of this particular pensive tinge she was not accustomed to. It interested
      her, and made her wonder what sort of man Mr. Le Breton might really be.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, you know, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; said old Mrs. Martindale,
      complacently, &lsquo;we must remember that Providence has wisely ordained
      that we shouldn&rsquo;t all of us be masons or carpenters. Some of us are
      clergymen, now, and look what a useful, valuable life a clergyman&rsquo;s
      is, after all, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Berkeley?&rsquo; Berkeley smiled a
      faint smile of amusement, but said nothing. &lsquo;Others are squires and
      landed gentry; and I&rsquo;m sure the landed gentry are very desirable in
      keeping up the tone of the country districts, and setting a pattern of
      virtue and refinement to their poorer neighbours. What would the country
      villages be, for example, if it weren&rsquo;t for the centres of culture
      afforded by the rectory and the hall, eh, Miss Oswald.&rsquo; Edith
      thought of quavering old Miss Catherine Luttrell gossiping with the rector&rsquo;s
      wife, and held her peace. &lsquo;You may depend upon it Providence has
      ordained these distinctions of classes for its own wise purposes, and we
      needn&rsquo;t trouble our heads at all about trying to alter them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ve always observed,&rsquo; said Harry Oswald, &lsquo;that
      Providence is supposed to have ordained the existing order for the time
      being, whatever it may be, but not the order that is at that exact moment
      endeavouring to supplant it. If I were to visit Central Africa, I should
      confidently expect to be told by the rain-doctors that Providence had
      ordained the absolute power of the chief, and the custom of massacring his
      wives and slaves at his open grave side. I believe in Russia it&rsquo;s
      usually allowed that Providence has placed the orthodox Czar at the head
      of the nation, and that any attempt to obtain a constitution from him is
      simply flat rebellion and flying in the face of Providence. In England we
      had a King John once, and we extracted a constitution out of him and
      sundry other kings by main force; and here, it&rsquo;s acquiescence in the
      present limited aristocratic government that makes up obedience to the
      Providential arrangement of things apparently. But how about America? eh,
      Mrs. Martindale? Did Providence ordain that George Washington was to rebel
      against his most sacred majesty King George III., or did it not? And did
      it ordain that George Washington was to knock his most sacred majesty&rsquo;s
      troops into a cocked hat, or did it not? And did it ordain that Abraham
      Lincoln was to free the slaves, or did it not? What I want to know is
      this: can it be said that Providence has ordained every class distinction
      in the whole world, from Dahomey to San Francisco? And has it ordained
      every Government, past and present, from the Chinese Empire to the French
      Convention? Did it ordain, for example, the revolution of &lsquo;89? That&rsquo;s
      the question I should like to have answered.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear me, Mr. Oswald,&rsquo; said the old lady meekly, taken aback by
      Harry&rsquo;s voluble vehemence: &lsquo;I suppose Providence permits some
      things and ordains others.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And does it permit American democracy or ordain it?&rsquo; asked the
      merciless Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don&rsquo;t you see, Mrs. Martindale,&rsquo; put in Berkeley, coming
      gently to her rescue, &lsquo;your principle amounts in effect to saying
      that whatever is, is right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Exactly,&rsquo; said the old lady, forgetting at once all about Dahomey
      or the Convention, and coming back mentally to her squires and rectors.
      &lsquo;The existing order is wisely arranged by Providence, and we mustn&rsquo;t
      try to set ourselves up against it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But if whatever is, is right,&rsquo; Edie said, laughing, &lsquo;then Mr.
      Le Breton&rsquo;s socialism must be right too, you see, because it exists
      in him no doubt for some wise purpose of Providence; and if he and those
      who think with him can succeed in changing things generally according to
      their own pattern, then the new system that they introduce will be the one
      that Providence has shown by the result to be the favoured one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In short,&rsquo; said Ernest, musingly, &lsquo;Mrs. Martindale&rsquo;s
      principle sanctifies success. It&rsquo;s the old theory of &ldquo;treason
      never prospers&mdash;what&rsquo;s the reason? Because whene&rsquo;er it
      prospers &lsquo;tis not treason.&rdquo; If we could only introduce a
      socialist republic, then it would be the reactionaries who would be
      setting themselves up against constituted authority, and so flying in the
      face of Providence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Fancy lecturing a recalcitrant archbishop and a remonstrant ci-devant
      duchess,&rsquo; cried Berkeley, lightly, &lsquo;upon the moral guilt and
      religious sinfulness of rebellion against the constituted authority of a
      communist phalanstery. It would be simply charming. I can imagine myself
      composing a dignified exhortation to deliver to his grace, entirely
      compiled out of his own printed pastorals, on the duty of submission and
      the danger of harbouring an insubordinate spirit. Do make me
      chaplain-in-ordinary to your house of correction for irreclaimable
      aristocrats, Le Breton, as soon as you once get your coming socialist
      republic fairly under way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Luncheon is on the table, sir,&rsquo; said the scout, breaking in
      unceremoniously upon their discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Arthur Berkeley lunched by himself upon a solitary commons of cold
      beef, he certainly did not treat his friends and guests in corresponding
      fashion. His little entertainment was of the daintiest and airiest
      character, so airy that, as Edie herself observed afterwards to Harry, it
      took away all the sense of meat and drink altogether, and left one only a
      pleased consciousness of full artistic gratification. Even Ernest, though
      he had his scruples about the aspic jelly, might eat the famous Magdalen
      chicken cutlets, his brother said, &lsquo;with a distinct feeling of
      exalted gratitude to the arduous culinary evolution of collective
      humanity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Consider,&rsquo; said Herbert, balancing neatly a little pyramid of whip
      cream and apricot jam upon his fork, &lsquo;consider what ages of slow
      endeavour must have gone to the development of such a complex mixture as
      this, Ernest, and thank your stars that you were born in this nineteenth
      century of Soyer and Francatelli, instead of being condemned to devour a
      Homeric feast with the unsophisticated aid of your own five fingers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But do tell me, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; asked Edie, with one of her pretty
      smiles, &lsquo;what will this socialist republic of yours be like when it
      actually comes about? I&rsquo;m dying to know all about it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really, Miss Oswald,&rsquo; Ernest answered, in a half-embarrassed tone,
      ‘I don&rsquo;t quite know how to reply to such a very wide and indefinite
      question. I haven&rsquo;t got any cut-and-dried constitutional scheme of
      my own for reorganising the whole system of society, any distinct panacea
      to cure all the ills that collective flesh is heir to. I leave the details
      of the future order to your brother Harry. The thing that troubles me is
      not so much how to reform the world at large as how to shape one&rsquo;s
      own individual course aright in the actual midst of it. As a single unit
      of the whole, I want rather guidance for my private conduct than a scheme
      for redressing the universal dislocation of things in general. It seems to
      me, every man&rsquo;s first duty is to see that he himself is in the right
      attitude towards society, and afterwards he may proceed to enquire whether
      society is in the right attitude towards him and all its other members.
      But if we were all to begin by redressing ourselves, there would be
      nothing left to redress, I imagine, when we turned to attack the second
      half of our problem. The great difficulty I myself experience is this,
      that <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t discover any adequate social justification for
      my own personal existence. But I really oughtn&rsquo;t to bore other
      people with my private embarrassments upon that head.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You see,&rsquo; said Herbert Le Breton, carelessly, &lsquo;my brother
      represents the ethical element in the socialist movement, Miss Oswald,
      while Harry represents the political element. Each is valuable in its way;
      but Oswald&rsquo;s is the more practical. You can move great masses into
      demanding their rights; you can&rsquo;t so easily move them into cordially
      recognising their duties. Hammer, hammer, hammer at the most obvious
      abuses; that&rsquo;s the way all the political victories are finally won.
      If I were a radical at all, I should go with you, Oswald. But happily I&rsquo;m
      not one; I prefer the calm philosophic attitude of perfectly objective
      neutrality.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And if I were a radical,&rsquo; said Berkeley, with a tinge of sadness in
      his voice as he poured himself out a glass of hock, &lsquo;I should go
      with Le Breton. But unfortunately I&rsquo;m not one, Miss Oswald, I&rsquo;m
      only a parson.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; A LITTLE MUSIC.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After lunch, Herbert Le Breton went off for his afternoon ride&mdash;a
      grave social misdemeanour, Ernest thought it&mdash;and Arthur Berkeley
      took Edie round to show her about the college and the shady gardens.
      Ernest would have liked to walk with her himself, for there was something
      in her that began to interest him somewhat; and besides, she was so
      pretty, and so graceful, and so sympathetic: but he felt he must not take
      her away from her host for the time being, who had a sort of proprietary
      right in the pleasing duty of acting as showman to her over his own
      college. So he dropped behind with Harry Oswald and old Mrs. Martindale,
      and endeavoured to simulate a polite interest in the old lady&rsquo;s
      scraps of conversation upon the heads of houses, their wives and families.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is Addison&rsquo;s Walk, Miss Oswald,&rsquo; said Berkeley, taking
      her through the gate into the wooded path beside the Cherwell; &lsquo;so
      called because the ingenious Mr. Addison is said to have specially
      patronised it. As he was an undergraduate of this college, and a
      singularly lazy person, it&rsquo;s very probable that he really did so;
      every other undergraduate certainly does, for it&rsquo;s the nearest walk
      an idle man can get without ever taking the trouble to go outside the
      grounds of Magdalen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The ingenious Mr. Addison was quite right then,&rsquo; Edie answered,
      smiling; &lsquo;for he couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a lovelier place on
      earth to stroll in. How exquisite it looks just now, with the mellow light
      falling down upon the path through this beautiful autumnal foliage! It&rsquo;s
      just a natural cathedral aisle, with a lot of pale straw-coloured glass in
      the painted windows, like that splendid one we went to see the other day
      at Merton Chapel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, there are certainly tones in that window I never saw in any other,&rsquo;
      Berkeley said, &lsquo;and the walk to-day is very much the same in its
      delicate colouring. You&rsquo;re fond of colour, I should think, Miss
      Oswald, from what you say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, nobody could help being struck by the autumn colouring of the Thames
      valley, I should fancy,&rsquo; said Edie, blushing. &lsquo;We noticed it
      all the way up as we came in the train from Reading, a perfect glow of
      crimson and orange at Pangbourne, Goring, Mapledurham, and Nuneham. I
      always thought the Dart in October the loveliest blaze of warm reds and
      yellows I had ever seen anywhere in nature, but the Thames valley beats it
      hollow, as Harry says. This walk to-day is just one&rsquo;s ideal picture
      of Milton&rsquo;s Vallombrosa.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes, I always look forward to the first days of October term,&rsquo;
      said Berkeley, slowly, &lsquo;as one of the greatest and purest treats in
      the whole round workaday twelvemonth. When the creeper on the Founder&rsquo;s
      Tower first begins to redden and crimson in the autumn, I could sit all
      day long by my open window, and just look at that glorious sight alone
      instead of having my dinner. But I&rsquo;m very fond of these walks in
      full summer time too. I often stop up alone all through the long (being
      tied to my curacy here permanently, you know), and then I have the run of
      the place entirely to myself. Sometimes I take my flute out, and sit under
      the shade here and compose some of my little pieces.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I can easily understand that they were composed here,&rsquo; said Edie
      quickly. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve caught exactly the flavour of the place&mdash;especially
      your exquisite little Penseroso.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, you know my music, then, Miss Oswald?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh yes, Harry always brings me home all your pieces whenever he comes
      back at the end of term. I can play every one of them without the notes.
      But the Penseroso is my special favourite.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s mine, too. I&rsquo;m so glad you like it. But I&rsquo;m
      working away at a little thing now which you shall hear as soon as I&rsquo;ve
      finished it; something lighter and daintier than anything else I&rsquo;ve
      ever attempted. I shall call it the Butterfly Canzonet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why don&rsquo;t you publish your music under your own name, Mr. Berkeley?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, because it would never do. I&rsquo;m a parson now, and I must keep up
      the dignity of the cloth by fighting shy of any aesthetic heterodoxies. It
      would be professional suicide for me to be suspected of artistic leanings.
      All very well in an archdeacon, you know, to cultivate his tastes for
      chants and anthems, but for a simple curate!&mdash;and secular songs too!&mdash;why,
      it would be sheer contumacy. His chances of a living would shrink at once
      to what your brother would call a vanishing quantity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, you can&rsquo;t imagine how much I admire your songs and airs, Mr.
      Berkeley. I was so pleased when you invited us, to think I was going to
      lunch with a real composer. There&rsquo;s no music I love so much as
      yours.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m very glad to hear it, Miss Oswald, I assure you. But I&rsquo;m
      only a beginner and a trifler yet. Some day I mean to produce something
      that will be worth listening to. Only, do you remember what some French
      novelist once said?&mdash;&ldquo;A poet&rsquo;s sweetest poem is always
      the one he has never been able to compose.&rdquo; I often think that&rsquo;s
      true of music, too. Away up in the higher stories of one&rsquo;s brain
      somewhere, there&rsquo;s a tune floating about, or rather a whole oratorio
      full of them, that one can never catch and fix upon ruled paper. The idea&rsquo;s
      there, such a beautiful and vague idea, so familiar to one, but so utterly
      unrealisable on any known instrument&mdash;a sort of musical Ariel,
      flitting before one and tantalising one for ever, but never allowing one
      to come up with it and see its real features. I&rsquo;m always
      dissatisfied with what I&rsquo;ve actually written, and longing to
      crystallise into a score the imaginary airs I can never catch. Except in
      this last piece of mine; that&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;ve ever done
      that thoroughly and completely pleases me. Come and see me next week, and
      I&rsquo;ll play it over to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked all round the meadows, and back again beside the arches of the
      beautiful bridge, and then returned to Berkeley&rsquo;s rooms once more
      for a cup of afternoon tea, and an air or two of Berkeley&rsquo;s own
      composing. Edie enjoyed the walk and the talk immensely; she enjoyed the
      music even more. In a way, it was all so new to her. For though she had
      always seen much of Harry, and though Harry, who was the kindest and
      proudest of brothers, had always instinctively kept her up to his own
      level of thought and conversation, still, she wasn&rsquo;t used to seeing
      so many intelligent and educated young men together, and the novelty of
      their society was delightfully exhilarating to her eager little mind. To a
      bright girl of nineteen, wherever she may come from, the atmosphere of
      Oxford has a wonderfully cheering and stimulating effect; to a country
      tradesman&rsquo;s daughter from a tiny west-country village it is like a
      little paradise on earth with a ceaseless round of intensely enjoyable
      breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, and water-parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest, for his part, was not so well pleased. He wanted to have a little
      conversation with Oswald&rsquo;s sister; and he was compelled by
      politeness to give her up in favour of Arthur Berkeley. However, he made
      up for it when he returned, and monopolised the pretty little visitor
      himself for almost the entire tea-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they had gone, Arthur Berkeley sported his oak, and sat down by
      himself in his comfortable crimson-covered basket chair. ‘I won&rsquo;t
      let anybody come and disturb me this evening,&rsquo; he said to himself
      moodily. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t let any of these noisy Magdalen men come
      with their racket and riot to cut off the memory of that bright little
      dream. No desecration after she has gone. Little Miss Butterfly! What a
      pretty, airy, dainty, delicate little morsel it is! How she flits, and
      sips, and natters about every possible subject, just touching the tip of
      it so gracefully with her tiny white fingers, and blushing so unfeignedly
      when she thinks she&rsquo;s paid you a compliment, or you&rsquo;ve paid
      her one. How she blushed when she said she liked my music! How she blushed
      when I said she had a splendid ear for minute discrimination! Somehow, if
      I were a falling-in-love sort of fellow, I half fancy I could manage to
      fall in love with her on the spot. Or rather, if I were a good analytical
      psychologist, perhaps I ought more correctly to say I AM in love with her
      already.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down idly at the piano and played a few bars softly to himself&mdash;a
      beautiful, airy sort of melody, as it shaped itself vaguely in his head at
      the moment, with a little of the new wine of first love running like a
      trill through the midst of its fast-flowing quavers and dainty
      undulations. &lsquo;That will do,&rsquo; he said to himself approvingly.
      &lsquo;That will do very well; that&rsquo;s little Miss Butterfly. Here
      she flits, flits, flits, flickers, sip, sip, sip, at her honeyed flowers;
      twirl away, whirl away, off in the sunshine&mdash;there you go, Miss
      Butterfly, eddying and circling with your painted mate. Flirt, flirt,
      flirt, coquetting and curvetting, in your pretty rhythmical aërial
      quadrille. Down again, down to the hare-bell on the hill side; sip at it,
      sip at it, sip at it, sweet little honey-drops, clear little honey-drops,
      bright little honey-drops; oh, for a song to be set to the melody!
      Tra-la-la, tro-lo-lo, up again, Butterfly. Little silk handkerchief,
      little lace neckerchief, fluttering, fluttering! Feathery wings of her,
      bright little eyes of her, flit, flit, flicker! Now, she blushes, blushes,
      blushes; deep crimson; oh, what a colour! Paint it, painter! Now she
      speaks. Oh, what laughter! Silvery, silvery, treble, treble, treble; trill
      away, trill away, silvery treble. Musical, beautiful; beautiful, musical;
      little Miss Butterfly&mdash;fly&mdash;fly&mdash;fly away!&rsquo; And he
      brought his fingers down upon the gamut at last, with a hasty, flickering
      touch that seemed really as delicate as Edie&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I can never get words for it in English,&rsquo; he said again, half
      speaking with his parted lips; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s too dactylic in rhythm
      for English verse to go to it. Béranger might have written a lilt for it,
      as far as mere syllables go, but Béranger to write about Miss Butterfly!&mdash;pho,
      no Frenchman could possibly catch it. Swinburne could fit the metres, I
      dare say, but he couldn&rsquo;t fit the feeling. It shall be a song
      without words, unless I write some Italian lines for it myself. Animula,
      blandula vagula&mdash;that&rsquo;s the sort of ring for it, but Latin&rsquo;s
      mostly too heavy. Io, Hymen, Hymenae, Io; Io, Hymen, Hymenae! What&rsquo;s
      that? A wedding song of Catullus&mdash;absit omen. I must be in love with
      her indeed.&rsquo; He got up from the piano, and paced quickly and
      feverishly up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And yet,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;if only I weren&rsquo;t bound down so
      by this unprofitable trade of parson! A curate on eighty pounds a year,
      and a few pupils! The presumptuousness of the man in venturing to think of
      falling in love, as if he were actually one of the beneficed clergy! What
      are deacons coming to, I wonder! And yet, hath not a deacon eyes; hath not
      a deacon hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? If you
      prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? And if you
      show us a little Miss Butterfly, beautiful to the finger-ends, do we not
      fall in love with her at least as unaffectedly as if we were canons
      residentiary or rural deans? Fancy little Miss Butterfly a rural deaness!
      the notion&rsquo;s too ridiculous. Fly away, little Miss Butterfly; fly
      away, sweet little frolicsome, laughsome creature. I won&rsquo;t try to
      tie you down to a man in a black clerical coat with a very distant
      hypothetical reversionary prospect of a dull and dingy country parsonage.
      Flit elsewhere, little Miss Butterfly, flit elsewhere, and find yourself a
      gayer, gaudier-coloured mate!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down again, and strummed a few more bars of his half-composed,
      half-extemporised melody. Then he leant back on the music-stool, and said
      gently to himself once more: &lsquo;Still, if it were possible, how happy
      I should try to make her! Bright little Miss Butterfly, I would try never
      to let a cold cloud pass chillily over your sunshiny head! I would live
      for you, and work for you, and write songs for your sake, all full of you,
      you, you, and so all full of life and grace and thrilling music. What&rsquo;s
      my life good for, to me or to the world? &ldquo;A clergyman&rsquo;s life
      is such a useful one,&rdquo; that amiable old conventionality gurgled out
      this morning; what&rsquo;s the good of mine, as it stands now, to its
      owner or to anybody else, I should like to know, except the dear old
      Progenitor? A mere bit of cracked blue china, a fanciful air from a comic
      opera, masquerading in black and white as a piece of sacred music! What
      good am I to anyone on earth but the Progenitor (God bless him!), and when
      he&rsquo;s gone, dear old fellow, what on earth shall I have left to live
      for. A selfish blank, that&rsquo;s all. But with HER, ah, how different!
      With her to live for and to cherish, with an object to set before oneself
      as worth one&rsquo;s consideration, what mightn&rsquo;t I do at last? Make
      her happy&mdash;after all, that&rsquo;s the great thing. Make her fond of
      my music, that music that floats and evades me now, but would harden into
      scores as if by magic with her to help one to spell it out&mdash;I know it
      would, at last, I know it would. Ah, well, perhaps some day I may be able;
      perhaps some day the dream will realise itself; till then, work, work,
      work; let me try to work towards making it possible, a living or a
      livelihood, no matter which. But not a breath of it to you meanwhile, Miss
      Butterfly; flit about freely and joyously while you may; I would not spoil
      your untrammelled flight for worlds by trying to tether it too soon around
      the fixed centre of my own poor doubtful diaconal destinies.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment while Arthur Berkeley was thus garrulously conversing
      with his heated fancy, Harry and Edie Oswald were strolling lazily down
      the High, to Edie&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, what do you think now of Berkeley and Le Breton, Edie?&rsquo; asked
      her brother. &lsquo;Which of them do you like the best?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I like them both immensely, Harry; I really can&rsquo;t choose between
      them. When Mr. Berkeley plays, he almost makes me fall in love with him;
      and when Mr. Le Breton talks, he almost makes me transfer my affections to
      him instead... But Mr. Berkeley plays divinely... And Mr. Le Breton talks
      beautifully... You know, I&rsquo;ve never seen such clever men before&mdash;except
      you, of course, Harry dear, for you&rsquo;re cleverer and nicer than
      anybody. Oh, do let me look at those lovely silks over there?&rsquo; And
      she danced across the road before he could answer her, like a tripping
      sylph in a painter&rsquo;s dreamland.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s very nice,&rsquo; she went on, after she had duly
      examined and classified the silks, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t exactly
      understand what it is he&rsquo;s got on his conscience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing whatsoever, except the fact of his own existence,&rsquo; Harry
      answered with a laugh. &lsquo;He has conscientious scruples against the
      existence of idle people in the community&mdash;do-nothings and eat-alls&mdash;and
      therefore he has conscientious scruples against himself for not
      immediately committing suicide. I believe, if he did exactly what he
      thought was abstractly right, he&rsquo;d go away and cut his own throat
      incontinently for an unprofitable, unproductive, useless citizen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, dear, I hope he&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rsquo; cried Edie
      hastily. ‘I think I shall really ask him not to for my sake, if not for
      anybody else&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He&rsquo;d be very much flattered indeed by your interposition on his
      behalf, no doubt, Popsy; but I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t produce
      much effect upon his ultimate decision.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tell me, Harry, is Mr. Berkeley High Church?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh dear no, I shouldn&rsquo;t say so. I don&rsquo;t suppose he ever gave
      the subject a single moment&rsquo;s consideration.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But St. Fredegond&rsquo;s is very High Church, I&rsquo;m told.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes; but Berkeley&rsquo;s curate of St. Fredegond&rsquo;s, not in
      virtue of his theology&mdash;I never heard he&rsquo;d got any to speak of&mdash;but
      in virtue of his musical talents. He went into the Church, I suppose, on
      purely aesthetic grounds. He liked a musical service, and it seemed
      natural to him to take part in one, just as it seemed natural to a
      mediaeval Italian with artistic tendencies to paint Madonnas and St.
      Sebastians. There&rsquo;s nothing more in his clerical coat than that, I
      fancy, Edie. He probably never thought twice about it on theological
      grounds.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, but that&rsquo;s very wrong of him, Harry. I don&rsquo;t mean having
      no particular theological beliefs, of course; one expects that nowadays;
      but going into the Church without them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, you see, Edie, you mustn&rsquo;t judge Berkeley in quite the same
      way as you&rsquo;d judge other people. In his mind, the aesthetic side is
      always uppermost; the logical side is comparatively in abeyance. Questions
      of creed, questions of philosophical belief, questions of science don&rsquo;t
      interest him at all; he looks at all of them from the point of view of the
      impression alone. What he sees in the Church is not a body of dogmas, like
      the High Churchmen, nor a set of opinions, like the Low Churchmen, but a
      close corporation of educated and cultivated gentlemen, charged with the
      duty of caring for a number of beautiful mediaeval architectural
      monuments, and of carrying on a set of grand and impressive musical or
      oral services. To him, a cathedral is a magnificent historical heritage; a
      sermon is a sort of ingenious literary exercise; and a hymn is a capital
      vehicle for very solemn emotional music. That&rsquo;s all; and we can
      hardly blame him for not seeing these things as we should see them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Harry, I don&rsquo;t know. I like them both immensely. Mr. Berkeley&rsquo;s
      very nice, but perhaps I like Mr. Le Breton the best of the two.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; ASKELON VILLA, GATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Number, 28, Epsilon Terrace, Bayswater, was one of the very smallest
      houses that a person with any pretensions to move in that Society which
      habitually spells itself with a capital initial could ever possibly have
      dreamt of condescending to inhabit. Indeed, if Dame Eleanor, relict of the
      late Sir Owen Le Breton, Knight, had consulted merely the length of her
      purse and the interests of her personal comfort, she would doubtless have
      found for the same rental a far more convenient and roomy cottage in Upper
      Clapton or Stoke Newington. But Lady Le Breton was a thoroughly and
      conscientiously religious woman, who in all things consulted first and
      foremost the esoteric interests of her ingrained creed. It was a prime
      article of this cherished social faith that nobody with any shadow of
      personal self-respect could endure to live under any other postal letter
      than W. or S.W. Better not to be at all than to drag out a miserable
      existence in the painful obscurity of N. or S.E. Happily for people
      situated like Lady Le Breton, the metropolitan house-contractor (it would
      be gross flattery to describe him as a builder) has divined, with his
      usual practical sagacity, the necessity for supplying this felt want for
      eligible family residences at once comparatively cheap and relatively
      fashionable. By driving little culs-de-sac and re-entrant alleys at the
      back of his larger rows of shoddy mansions, he is enabled to run up a
      smaller terrace, or crescent, or place, as the case may be, composed of
      tiny shallow cottages with the narrowest possible frontage, and the
      tallest possible elevation, which will yet entitle their occupiers to feel
      themselves within the sacred pale of social salvation, in the blest
      security of the mystic W. Narrowest, shallowest, and tallest of these
      marginal Society residences is the little block of blank-faced,
      stucco-fronted, porticoed rabbit-hutches, which blazons itself forth in
      the Court Guide under the imposing designation of Epsilon Terrace,
      Bayswater.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of No. 28 in this eminently respectable back alley was quite
      of a piece, it must be confessed, with the vacant Philistinism of its
      naked exterior. &lsquo;Mother has really an immense amount of taste,&rsquo;
      Herbert Le Breton used to say, blandly, &lsquo;and all of it of the most
      atrocious description; she picked it up, I believe, when my poor father
      was quartered at Lahore, a station absolutely fatal to the aesthetic
      faculties; and she will never get rid of it again as long as she lives.&rsquo;
      Indeed, when once Lady Le Breton got anything whatsoever into her head, it
      was not easy for anybody else to get it out again; you might much more
      readily expect to draw one of her double teeth than to eliminate one of
      her pet opinions. Not that she was a stupid or a near-sighted woman&mdash;the
      mother of clever sons never is&mdash;but she was a perfectly immovable
      rock of social and political orthodoxy. The three Le Breton boys&mdash;for
      there was a third at home&mdash;would gladly have reformed the terrors of
      that awful drawing-room if they had dared; but they knew it was as much as
      their places were worth, Herbert said, to attempt a remonstrance, and they
      wisely left it alone, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the house was not vulgarly furnished, at least in the
      conventional sense of the word; Lady Le Breton was far too rigid in her
      social orthodoxy to have admitted into her rooms anything that savoured of
      what she considered bad form, according to her lights. It was only vulgar
      with the underlying vulgarity of mere tasteless fashionable uniformity.
      There was nothing in it that any well-bred footman could object to;
      nothing that anybody with one grain of genuine originality could possibly
      tolerate. The little occasional chairs and tables set casually about the
      room were of the strictest négligé Belgravian type, a sort of studied
      protest against the formal stiffness of the ordinary unused middle-class
      drawing-room. The portrait of the late Sir Owen in the wee library,
      presented by his brother-officers, was painted by that distinguished R.
      A., Sir Francis Thomson, a light of the middle of this century; and an
      excellent work of art it was too, in its own solemn academic kind. The
      dining-room, tiny as it was, possessed that inevitable Canaletti without
      which no gentleman&rsquo;s dining-room in England is ever considered to be
      complete. Everything spoke at once the stereotyped Society style of a
      dozen years ago (before Mr. Morris had reformed the outer aspect of the
      West End), entirely free from anything so startling or indecorous as a
      gleam of spontaneity in the possessor&rsquo;s mind. To be sure, it was
      very far indeed from the centre round-table and
      brilliant-flowered-table-cover style of the utter unregenerate Philistine
      household; but it was further still from the simple natural taste and
      graceful fancy of Edie Oswald&rsquo;s cosy little back parlour behind the
      village grocer&rsquo;s shop at Calcombe-Pomeroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait and the Canaletti were relics of Lady Le Breton&rsquo;s best
      days, when Sir Owen was alive, and the boys were still in their first
      babyhood. Sir Owen was an Indian officer of the old school, a
      simple-minded, gentle, brave man, very religious after his own fashion,
      and an excellent soldier, with the true Anglo-Indian faculty for
      administration and organisation. It was partly from him, no doubt, that
      the boys inherited their marked intelligence; and it was wholly from him,
      beyond any doubt at all, that Ernest and his younger brother Ronald
      inherited their moral or religious sincerity&mdash;for that was an element
      in which poor formally orthodox Lady Le Breton was wholly deficient. The
      good General had been brought up in the strictest doctrines of the Clapham
      sect; he had gone to India young, as a cadet from Haileybury; and he had
      applied his intellect all his life long rather to the arduous task of
      extending &lsquo;the blessings of British rule&rsquo; to Sikhs and
      Ghoorkas, than to those abstract ethical or theological questions which
      agitated the souls of a later generation. If a new district had to be
      assimilated in settlement to the established model of the British raj, if
      a tribe of hill-savages had to be conciliated by gentler means than rifles
      or bayonets, if a difficult bit of diplomatic duty had to be performed on
      the debateable frontiers, Sir Owen Le Breton was always the person chosen
      to undertake it. An earnest, honest, God-fearing man he remained to the
      end, impressed by a profound sense of duty as he understood it, and a firm
      conviction that his true business in life consisted in serving his Queen
      and country, and in bringing more and more of the native populations
      within the pale of the Company&rsquo;s empire, and the future
      evangelisation that was ultimately to follow. But during the great
      upheaval of the Mutiny, he fell at the head of his own unrevolted regiment
      in one of the hottest battles of that terrible time, and my Lady Le Breton
      found herself left alone with three young children, on little more than
      the scanty pension of a general officer&rsquo;s widow on the late Company&rsquo;s
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, enough remained to bring up the boys, with the aid of their
      terminable annuities (which fell in on their attaining their majority), in
      decent respect for the feelings and demands of exacting Society; and as
      the two elder were decidedly clever boys, they managed to get scholarships
      at Oxford, which enabled them to tide over the dangerous intermediate
      period as far as their degree. Herbert then stepped at once into a
      fellowship and sundry other good things of like sort; and Ernest was even
      now trying to follow in his brother&rsquo;s steps, in this particular.
      Only the youngest boy, Ronald, still remained quite unprovided for. Ronald
      was a tall, pale, gentle, weakly, enthusiastic young fellow of nineteen,
      with so marked a predisposition to lung disease that it had not been
      thought well to let him run the chance of over-reading himself; and so he
      had to be content with remaining at home in the uncongenial atmosphere of
      Epsilon Terrace, instead of joining his two elder brothers at the
      university. Uncongenial, because Ronald alone followed Sir Owen in the
      religious half of his nature, and found the &lsquo;worldliness&rsquo; and
      conventionality of his unflinching mother a serious bar to his enjoyment
      of home society.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ronald,&rsquo; said my lady, at the breakfast-table on the very morning
      of Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s little luncheon party, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a
      letter for you from Mackenzie and Anderson. No doubt your Aunt Sarah&rsquo;s
      will has been recovered and proved at last, and I hope it&rsquo;ll turn
      out satisfactory, as we wish it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For my part, I really almost hope it won&rsquo;t, mother,&rsquo; said
      Ronald, turning it over; &lsquo;for I don&rsquo;t want to be compelled to
      profit by Ernest&rsquo;s excessive generosity. He&rsquo;s too good to me,
      just because he thinks me the weaker vessel; but though we must bear one
      another&rsquo;s burdens, you know, we should each bear his own cross as
      well, shouldn&rsquo;t we, mother?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, it can&rsquo;t be much in any case,&rsquo; said his mother, a
      little testily, &lsquo;whoever gets it. Open the envelope at once, my boy,
      and don&rsquo;t stand looking at it like a goose in that abstracted way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, mother, she was my father&rsquo;s only sister, and I&rsquo;m not in
      such a hurry to find out how she has disposed of her mere perishing
      worldly goods,&rsquo; answered Ronald, gravely. &lsquo;It seems to me a
      terrible thing that before poor dear good Aunt Sarah is cold in her grave
      almost, we should be speculating and conjecturing as to what she has done
      with her poor little trifle of earthly riches.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s always usual to read the will immediately after the funeral,&rsquo;
      said Lady Le Breton, firmly, to whom the ordinary usage of society formed
      an absolutely unanswerable argument; &lsquo;and how you, Ronald, who haven&rsquo;t
      even the common decency to wear a bit of crape around your arm for her&mdash;a
      thing that Ernest himself, with all his nonsensical theories, consents to
      do&mdash;can talk in that absurd way about what&rsquo;s quite right and
      proper to be done, I for my part, really can&rsquo;t imagine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, but you know, mother, I object to wearing crape on the ground that it
      isn&rsquo;t allowable for us to sorrow as them that have no hope: and I&rsquo;m
      sure I&rsquo;m paying no disrespect to dear Aunt Sarah&rsquo;s memory in
      this matter, for she was always the first herself, you remember, to wish
      that I should follow the dictates of my own conscience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I remember she always upheld you in acts of opposition to your own
      mother, Ronald,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton said coldly, &lsquo;and I suppose
      you&rsquo;re going to do honour to her religious precepts now by not
      opening that letter when your mother tells you to do so. In MY Bible, sir,
      I find a place for the Fourth Commandment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald looked at her gently and unreprovingly; but though a quiet smile
      played involuntarily around the corners of his mouth, he resisted the
      natural inclination to correct her mistake, and to suggest blandly that
      she probably alluded to the fifth. He knew he must turn his left cheek
      also&mdash;a Christian virtue which he had abundant opportunities of
      practising in that household; and he felt that to score off his mother for
      such a verbal mistake as the one she had just made would not be in keeping
      with the spirit of the commandment to which, no doubt, she meant to refer
      him. So without another word he opened the envelope and glanced rapidly at
      the contents of the letter it enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They&rsquo;ve found the second will,&rsquo; he said, after a moment, with
      a rather husky voice, &lsquo;and they&rsquo;re taking steps to get it
      confirmed, whatever that may be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Broad Scotch for getting probate, I believe,&rsquo; said Lady Le Breton,
      in a slight tone of irony; for to her mind any departure from the laws or
      language she was herself accustomed to use, assumed at once the guise of a
      rank and offensive provincialism. &lsquo;Your poor Aunt WOULD go and marry
      a Scotchman, and he a Scotch business man too; so of course we must expect
      to put up with all kinds of ridiculous technicalities and Edinburgh jargon
      accordingly. All law&rsquo;s bad enough in the way of odd words, but
      commend me to Scotch law for utter and meaningless incomprehensibility.
      Well, and what does the second will say, Ronald?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, mother,&rsquo; cried Ronald, flinging the letter down hurriedly
      with a burst of tears. &lsquo;Read it yourself, if you will, for I can&rsquo;t.
      Poor dear Aunt Sarah, and dear, good unselfish Ernest! It makes me cry
      even to think of them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Le Breton took the paper up from the table without a word and read it
      carefully through. &lsquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rsquo; she said,
      ‘very glad indeed to hear it. &ldquo;And in order to guard against any
      misinterpretation of my reasons for making this disposition of my
      property,&rdquo; your Aunt says, &ldquo;I wish to put it on record that I
      had previously drawn up another will, bequeathing my effects to be divided
      between my two nephews Ernest and Ronald Le Breton equally; that I
      communicated the contents of that will&rdquo;&mdash;a horrid Scotticism&mdash;&ldquo;to
      my nephew Ernest; and that at his express desire I have now revoked it,
      and drawn up this present testament, leaving the share intended for him to
      his brother Ronald.&rdquo; Why, she never even mentions dear Herbert!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She knew that Herbert had provided for himself,&rsquo; Ronald answered,
      raising his head from his hands, &lsquo;while Ernest and I were unprovided
      for. But Ernest said he could fight the world for himself, while I couldn&rsquo;t;
      and that unearned wealth ought only to be accepted in trust for those who
      were incapacitated by nature or misfortune from earning their own bread. I
      don&rsquo;t always quite agree with all Ernest&rsquo;s theories any more
      than you do, but we must both admit that at least he always
      conscientiously acts up to them himself, mother, mustn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s a very extraordinary thing,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton went on,
      &lsquo;that Aunt Sarah invariably encouraged both you boys in all your
      absurdities and Quixotisms. She was Quixotic herself at heart, that&rsquo;s
      the truth of it, just like your poor dear father. I remember once, when we
      were quartered at Meean Meer in the Punjaub, poor dear Sir Owen nearly got
      into disgrace with the colonel&mdash;he was only a sub. in those days&mdash;because
      he wanted to go trying to convert his syces, which was a most imprudent
      thing to do, and directly opposed to the Company&rsquo;s orders. Aunt
      Sarah was just the same. Herbert&rsquo;s the only one of you three who has
      never given me one moment&rsquo;s anxiety, and of course poor Herbert must
      be passed over in absolute silence. However, I&rsquo;m very glad she&rsquo;s
      left the money to you, Ronald, as you need it the most, and Mackenzie and
      Anderson say it&rsquo;ll come to about a hundred and sixty a year.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘One can do a great deal of good with that much money,&rsquo; said Ronald
      meditatively. &lsquo;I mean, after arranging with you, mother, for the
      expenses of my maintenance at home, which of course I shall do, as soon as
      the pension ceases, and after meeting one&rsquo;s own necessary
      expenditure in the way of clothing and so forth. It&rsquo;s more than any
      one Christian man ought to spend upon himself, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s not at all too much for a young man in your position in
      society, Ronald; but there&mdash;I know you&rsquo;ll want to spend half of
      it on indiscriminate charity. However, there&rsquo;ll be time enough to
      talk about that when you&rsquo;ve actually got it, thank goodness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald murmured a few words softly to himself, of which Lady Le Breton
      only caught the last echo&mdash;&lsquo;laid them down at the apostles&rsquo;
      feet; and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Just like Ernest&rsquo;s communistic notions,&rsquo; she murmured in
      return, half audibly. &lsquo;I do declare, between them both, a plain
      woman hardly knows whether she&rsquo;s standing on her head or on her
      heels. I live in daily fear that one or other of them will be taken up by
      the police, for being implicated in some dynamite plot or other, to blow
      up the Queen or destroy the Houses of Parliament.&rsquo; Ronald smiled
      again, gently, but answered nothing. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s another letter
      for you there, though, with the Exmoor coronet upon it. Why don&rsquo;t
      you open it? I hope it&rsquo;s an invitation for you to go down and stop
      at Dunbude for a week or two. Nothing on earth would do you so much good
      as to get away for a while from your ranters and canters, and mix
      occasionally in a little decent and rational society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald took up the second letter with a sigh. He feared as much himself,
      and had doleful visions of a painful fortnight to be spent in a big
      country house, where the conversation would be all concerning the
      slaughter of pheasants and the torture of foxes, which his soul loathed to
      listen to. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s from Lady Hilda,&rsquo; he said, glancing
      through it, &lsquo;and it ISN&rsquo;T an invitation after all.&rsquo; He
      could hardly keep down a faint tone of gratification as he discovered this
      reprieve. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s what she says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘"DEAR MR. LE BRETON,&mdash;Mamma wishes me to write and tell you that
      Lynmouth&rsquo;s tutor, Mr. Walsh, is going to leave us at Christmas, and
      she thinks it just possible that one of your two brothers at Oxford might
      like to come down to Dunbude and give us their kind aid in taking charge
      of Lynmouth. He&rsquo;s a dreadful pickle, as you know; but we are very
      anxious to get somebody to look after him in whom mamma can have perfect
      confidence. We don&rsquo;t know your brothers&rsquo; addresses or we would
      have written to them direct about it. Perhaps you will kindly let them
      hear this suggestion; and if they think the matter worth while, we might
      afterwards arrange details as to business and so forth. With kind regards
      to Lady Le Breton, believe me,
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘"Yours very sincerely,
    </p>
    <h3>
      ‘"HILDA TREGELLIS.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Ronald,&rsquo; said Lady Le Breton, much more warmly than before,
      ‘this is really quite providential. Are they at Dunbude now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, mother. She writes from Wilton Place. They&rsquo;re up in town for
      Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s gout, I know. I heard they were on Sunday.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then I shall go and see Lady Exmoor this very morning about it. It&rsquo;s
      exactly the right place for Ernest. A little good society will get rid of
      all his nonsensical notions in a month or two. He&rsquo;s lived too
      exclusively among his radical set at Oxford. And then it&rsquo;ll be such
      a capital thing for him to be in the house continually with Hilda; she&rsquo;s
      a girl of such excellent tone. I fancy&mdash;I&rsquo;m not quite sure, but
      I fancy&mdash;that Ernest has a decided taste for the company of people,
      and even of young girls, who are not in Society. He&rsquo;s so fond of
      that young man Oswald, who Herbert tells me is positively the son of a
      grocer&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m sure he said a grocer!&mdash;and it seems,
      from what Herbert writes me, that this Oswald has brought a sister of his
      up this term from behind the counter, on purpose to set her cap at Ernest.
      Now you boys have, unfortunately, no sisters, and therefore you haven&rsquo;t
      seen as much of girls of a good stamp&mdash;not daily and domestically I
      mean&mdash;as is desirable for you, from the point of view of Society. But
      if Ernest can only be induced to take this tutorship at the Exmoors&rsquo;,
      he&rsquo;ll have an opportunity of meeting daily with a really nice girl,
      like Hilda; and though of course it isn&rsquo;t likely that Hilda would
      take a fancy to her brother&rsquo;s tutor&mdash;the Exmoors are such VERY
      conservative people in matters of rank and wealth and family and so forth&mdash;quite
      un-Christianly so, I consider&mdash;yet it can&rsquo;t fail to improve
      Ernest&rsquo;s tone a great deal, and raise his standard of female society
      generally. It&rsquo;s really a very distressing thought to me, Ronald,
      that all my boys, except dear Herbert, should show such a marked
      preference for low and vulgar companionship. It seems to me, you both
      positively prefer as far as possible the society of your natural
      inferiors. There&rsquo;s Ernest must go and take up with the friendship of
      that snuffy old German Socialist glass-cutter; while you are always
      running after your Plymouth Brethren and your Bible Christians, and your
      other ignorant fanatical people, instead of going with me respectably to
      St. Alphege&rsquo;s to hear the dear Archdeacon! It&rsquo;s very
      discouraging to a mother, really, very discouraging.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; DOWN THE RIVER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘Berkeley couldn&rsquo;t come to-day, Le Breton: it&rsquo;s Thursday, of
      course: I forgot about it altogether,&rsquo; Oswald said, on the barge at
      Salter&rsquo;s. &lsquo;You know he pays a mysterious flying visit to town
      every Thursday afternoon&mdash;to see an imprisoned lady-love, I always
      tell him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s very late in the season for taking ladies on the water, Miss
      Oswald,&rsquo; said Ernest, putting his oar into the rowlock, and secretly
      congratulating himself on the deliverance; &lsquo;but better go now than
      not see Iffley church and Nuneham woods at all. You ought to have come up
      in summer term, and let us have the pleasure of showing you over the place
      when it was in its full leafy glory. May&rsquo;s decidedly the time to see
      Oxford to the greatest advantage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So Harry tells me, and he wanted me to come up then, but it wasn&rsquo;t
      convenient for them at home to spare me just at that moment, so I was
      obliged to put it off till late in the autumn. I have to help my mother a
      good deal in the house, you know, and I can&rsquo;t always go dancing
      about the world whenever I should like to. Which string must I pull,
      Harry, to make her turn into the middle of the river? She always seems to
      twist round the exact way I don&rsquo;t want her to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Right, right, hard right,&rsquo; cried Harry from the bow&mdash;they were
      in a tub pair bound down the river for Iffley. &lsquo;Keep to the
      Oxfordshire shore as far as the willows; then cross over to the Berkshire.
      Le Breton&rsquo;ll tell you when and where to change sides; he knows the
      river as well as I do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That&rsquo;ll do splendidly for the present,&rsquo; Ernest said, looking
      ahead over his shoulder. &lsquo;Mind the flags there; don&rsquo;t go too
      near the corner. You certainly ought to see these meadows in early spring,
      when the fritillaries are all out over the spongy places, Miss Oswald. Has
      your brother ever sent you any of the fritillaries?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What? snake-heads? Oh, boxes full of them. They&rsquo;re lovely flowers,
      but not lovelier than our own Devonshire daffodils. You should see a
      Devonshire water-meadow in April! Why don&rsquo;t you come down some time
      to Calcombe Pomeroy? It&rsquo;s the dearest little peaceful seaside corner
      in all England.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry bit his lip, for he was not over-fond of bringing people down to spy
      out his domestic sanctities; but Ernest answered cordially, ‘I should like
      it above everything in the world, Miss Oswald. If you will let me, I
      certainly shall as soon as possible. Mind, quick, get out of the way of
      that practising eight, or we shall foul her! Left, as hard as you can!
      That&rsquo;ll do. The cox was getting as red as a salamander, till he saw
      it was a lady steering. When coxes catch a man fouling them, their
      language is apt to be highly unparliamentary.&mdash;Yes, I shall try to
      get away to Calcombe as soon as ever I can manage to leave Oxford. It
      wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if I were to run down and spend Christmas
      there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;d find it as dull as ditch-water at Christmas, Le Breton,&rsquo;
      said Harry. &lsquo;Much better wait till next summer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t think so, Harry dear,&rsquo; Edie
      interrupted, with that tell-tale blush of hers. &lsquo;If Mr. Le Breton
      wants to come then, I believe he&rsquo;d really find it quite delightful.
      Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t expect theatres, or dances, or anything like
      that, in a country village; and we&rsquo;re dreadfully busy just about
      Christmas day itself, sending out orders, and all that sort of thing,&rsquo;&mdash;Harry
      bit his lip again:&mdash;&lsquo;but if you don&rsquo;t mind a very quiet
      place and a very quiet time, Mr. Le Breton, I don&rsquo;t think myself our
      cliffs ever look grander, or our sea more impressive, than in stormy
      winter weather.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wish to goodness she wasn&rsquo;t so transparently candid and
      guileless,&rsquo; thought Harry to himself. &lsquo;I never CAN teach her
      duly to respect the prejudices of Pi. Not that it matters twopence to Le
      Breton, of course: but if she talks that way to any of the other men here,
      they&rsquo;ll be laughing in every common-room in Oxford over my Christmas
      raisins and pounds of sugar&mdash;commonplace cynics that they are. I must
      tell her about it the moment we get home again, and adjure her by all that&rsquo;s
      holy not to repeat the indiscretion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A penny for your thoughts, Harry,&rsquo; cried Edie, seeing by his look
      that she had somehow vexed him. &lsquo;What are you thinking of?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thinking that all Oxford men are horrid cynics,&rsquo; said Harry, boldly
      shaming the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why are they?&rsquo; Edie asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I suppose because it&rsquo;s an inexpensive substitute for wit or
      intellect,&rsquo; Harry answered. &lsquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m a bit of a
      cynic myself, I believe, for the same reason and on strictly economical
      principles. It saves one the trouble of having any intelligible or
      original opinion of one&rsquo;s own upon any subject.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Below Iffley Lock they landed for half an hour, in order to give Edie time
      for a pencil sketch of the famous old Norman church-tower, with its quaint
      variations on the dog-tooth ornament, and its ancient cross and mouldering
      yew-tree behind. Harry sat below in the boat, propped on the cushions,
      reading the last number of the ‘Nineteenth Century;&rsquo; Ernest and Edie
      took their seat upon the bank above, and had a first chance of an unbroken
      tête-à-tête.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How delicious to live in Oxford always!&rsquo; said Edie, sketching in
      the first outline of the great round arches. &lsquo;I would give anything
      to have the opportunity of settling here for life. Some day I shall make
      Harry set up house, and bring me up here as his housekeeper:&mdash;I mean,&rsquo;
      she added with a blush, thinking of Harry&rsquo;s warning look just
      before, &lsquo;as soon as they can spare me from home.&rsquo; She
      purposely avoided saying &lsquo;when they retire from business,&rsquo; the
      first phrase that sprang naturally to her simple little lips. &lsquo;Let
      me see, Mr. Le Breton; you haven&rsquo;t got any permanent appointment
      here yourself, have you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh no,&rsquo; Ernest answered: &lsquo;no appointment of any sort at all,
      Miss Oswald. I&rsquo;m loitering up casually on the look-out for a
      fellowship. I&rsquo;ve been in for two or three already, but haven&rsquo;t
      got them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; asked Edie, with a look of candid surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I suppose I wasn&rsquo;t clever enough,&rsquo; Ernest answered simply.
      &lsquo;Not so clever, I mean, as the men who actually got them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, but you MUST be,&rsquo; Edie replied confidently; &lsquo;and a great
      deal cleverer, too, I&rsquo;m sure. I know you must, because Harry told me
      you were one of the very cleverest men in the whole &lsquo;Varsity. And
      besides, I see you are, myself. And Harry says most of the men who get
      fellowships are really great donkeys.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Harry must have been talking in one of those cynical moods he told us
      about,&rsquo; said Ernest, laughing. &lsquo;At any rate, the examiners
      didn&rsquo;t feel satisfied with my papers, and I&rsquo;ve never got a
      fellowship yet. Perhaps they thought my political economy just a trifle
      too advanced for them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You may depend upon it, that&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; said Edie, jumping at the
      conclusion with the easy omniscience of a girl of nineteen. &lsquo;Next
      time, make your political economy a little more moderate, you know,
      without any sacrifice of principle, just to suit them. What fellowship are
      you going in for now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pembroke, in November.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, I do hope you&rsquo;ll get it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you very much. So do I. It would be very nice to have one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But of course it won&rsquo;t matter so much to you as it did to Harry.
      Your family are such very great people, aren&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest smiled a broad smile at her delicious simplicity. &lsquo;If by very
      great people you mean rich,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we couldn&rsquo;t very
      well be poorer&mdash;for people of our sort, I mean. My mother lives
      almost entirely on her pension; and we boys have only been able to come up
      to Oxford, just as Harry was, by the aid of our scholarships. If we hadn&rsquo;t
      saved in our first two years, while we had our government allowances, we
      shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to stop up for our degrees at all. So if I
      don&rsquo;t get a fellowship I shall have to take to school-mastering or
      something of the sort, for a livelihood. Indeed, this at Pembroke will be
      my very last chance, for I can&rsquo;t hold on much longer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And if you got a fellowship you could never marry, could you?&rsquo;
      asked Edie, going on with her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not, while I held it, certainly. But I wouldn&rsquo;t hold it long. I
      regard it only as a makeshift for a time. Unhappily, I don&rsquo;t know
      how to earn my own bread by the labour of my hands, as I think we ought
      all to do in a well-constituted society; so unless I choose to starve
      (about the rightfulness of which I don&rsquo;t feel quite certain), I MUST
      manage somehow to get over the interval. But as soon as I could I would
      try to find some useful work to do, in which I could repay society the
      debt I owe it for my bringing up. You see, I&rsquo;ve been fed and
      educated by a Government grant, which of course came out of the taxes&mdash;your
      people have had to help, whether they would or not, in paying for my board
      and lodging&mdash;and I feel that I owe it as a duty to the world to look
      out some employment in which I could really repay it for the cost of my
      maintenance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How funnily you do look at everything, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; said Edie.
      ‘It would never have struck me to think of a pension from the army in that
      light. And yet of course it&rsquo;s the right light; only we don&rsquo;t
      most of us take the trouble to go to the bottom of things, as you do. But
      what will you do if you don&rsquo;t get the fellowship?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In that case, I&rsquo;ve just heard from my mother that she would like me
      to take a tutorship at Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s,&rsquo; Ernest answered.
      &lsquo;Lynmouth, their eldest son, was my junior at school by six or seven
      years, and now he&rsquo;s going to prepare for Christ Church. I don&rsquo;t
      quite know whether it&rsquo;s a right place for me to accept or not; but I
      shall ask Max Schurz about it, if I don&rsquo;t get Pembroke. I always
      take Herr Max&rsquo;s advice in all questions of conscience, for I&rsquo;m
      quite sure whatever he approves of is the thing one ought to do for the
      greatest good of humanity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Harry told me about Herr Schurz,&rsquo; Edie said, filling in the details
      of the doorway. &lsquo;He thinks him a very earnest, self-convinced, good
      old man, but a terrible revolutionist. For my part, I believe I rather
      like revolutionists, provided, of course, they don&rsquo;t cut off people&rsquo;s
      heads. Harry made me read Carlyle, and I positively fell in love with
      Camille Desmoulins; only I don&rsquo;t really think he ought to have
      approved of QUITE so much guillotining, do you? But why shouldn&rsquo;t
      you take the tutorship at the Exmoors&rsquo;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, because it isn&rsquo;t a very useful work in the world to prepare a
      young hereditary loafer like Lynmouth for going to Christ Church. Lynmouth
      will be just like his father when he grows up&mdash;an amiable wholesale
      partridge-slayer; and I don&rsquo;t see that the world at large will be
      any the better or the worse off for his being able to grope his way
      somehow through two plays of Sophocles and the first six books of Euclid.
      If only one were a shoemaker now! What a delightful thing to sit down at
      the end of a day and say to oneself, &ldquo;I have made two pairs of good,
      honest boots for a fellow-mortal this week, and now I deserve to have my
      supper!&rdquo; Still, it&rsquo;ll be better, anyway, than doing nothing at
      all, and living off my mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you went to Dunbude, when would you go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘After the Christmas vacation, I suppose, from what Lady Hilda says.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lady Hilda? Oh, so there&rsquo;s a sister, is there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. A very pretty girl, about twenty, I should say, and rather clever
      too, I believe. My mother knows them a little.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Edie! What made her heart jump so at the mere mention of Lady
      Hilda? and what made the last few strokes at the top of the broken
      yew-tree look so very weak and shaky? How absurd of herself, she thought,
      to feel so much moved at hearing that there was another girl in the world
      whom Ernest might possibly fall in love with! And yet she had never even
      seen Ernest only ten days ago! Lady Hilda! What a grand name, to be sure,
      and what a grand person she must be. And then Ernest himself belonged by
      birth to the same class! For in poor little Edie&rsquo;s mind, innocent as
      she was of the nice distinctions of the peerage, Lady So-and-So was Lady
      So-and-So still, whoever she might be, from the wife of a premier marquis
      to the wife of the latest created knight bachelor. To her, Lady Hilda
      Tregellis and Lady Le Breton were both &lsquo;ladies of title&rsquo;; and
      the difference between their positions, which seemed so immense to Ernest,
      seemed nothing at all to the merry little country girl who sat sketching
      beside him. After all, how could she ever have even vaguely fancied that
      such a young man as Ernest, in spite of all his socialistic whims, would
      ever dream of caring for a girl of the people like her? No doubt he would
      go to the Exmoors&rsquo;, fall naturally in love with Lady Hilda, and
      marry decorously in what Edie considered his own proper sphere of life!
      She went on with the finishing touches of her little picture in silence,
      and folded it up into the tiny portfolio at last with a half-uttered sigh.
      So her poor wee castle in the air was knocked down before she had begun to
      build it up in any real seriousness, and she turned to join Harry in the
      boat almost without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope you&rsquo;ll get the Pembroke fellowship,&rsquo; she said again, a
      little later, as they rowed onward down the river to Nuneham. &lsquo;But
      in any case, Mr. Le Breton, you mustn&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;ve half
      promised to come and look us up at Calcombe Pomeroy in the Christmas
      vacation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest smiled, and nodded acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, on that same Thursday afternoon, Arthur Berkeley had gone up
      from Oxford by the fast train to Paddington, as was his weekly wont, and
      had dived quickly down one of the small lanes that open out from the
      left-hand side of Praed Street. He walked along it for a little way,
      humming an air to himself as he went, and then stopped at last in front of
      a small, decent brick house, with a clean muslin blind across the window
      (clean muslin forms a notable object in most London back streets), and a
      printed card hanging from the central pane, bearing the inscription,
      &lsquo;G. Berkeley, Working Shoemaker.&mdash;The Trade supplied with
      Ready-closed Uppers.&rsquo; At the window a beaming face was watching for
      his appearance, and Arthur said to himself as he saw it through the
      curtain, &lsquo;The dear old Progenitor&rsquo;s looking better again this
      week, God bless him!&rsquo; In a moment he had opened the door, and
      greeted his father in the old boyish fashion, with an honest kiss on
      either cheek. They had kissed one another so whenever they met from Arthur&rsquo;s
      childhood upward; and the Oxford curate had never felt himself grown too
      much of a man to keep up a habit which seemed to him by far the most
      sacred thing in his whole existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, father dear, I needn&rsquo;t ask you how you are to-day,&rsquo;
      said Arthur, seating himself comfortably in the second easy-chair of the
      trim little workshop parlour. &lsquo;I can see at once you&rsquo;re a good
      deal better. Any more pain in the head and eyes, eh, or any trouble about
      the forehead?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old shoemaker passed his hand over his big, bulging brow, bent outward
      as it is so often in men of his trade by the constant habit of stooping
      over their work, and said briskly, &lsquo;No, Artie, my boy, not a sign of
      it this week&mdash;not a single sign of it. I&rsquo;ve been taking a bit
      of holiday, you see, and it&rsquo;s done me a lot of good, I can tell you;&mdash;made
      me feel another man entirely. I&rsquo;ve been playing my violin till the
      neighbours began to complain of it; and if I hadn&rsquo;t asked them to
      come and hear me tune up a bit, I really believe they&rsquo;d have been
      having me up before the magistrate for a public nuisance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That&rsquo;s right, Daddy dear; I&rsquo;m always glad when you&rsquo;ve
      been having a little music. It does you more good than anything. And the
      jelly&mdash;I hope you&rsquo;ve eaten the jelly?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, I&rsquo;ve eaten it right enough, Artie, thank your dear heart; and
      the soup too, dearie. Came by a boy from Walters&rsquo;s every day,
      addressed to &ldquo;Berkeley, Esquire, 42 Whalley Street;&rdquo; and the
      boy wouldn&rsquo;t leave it the first day, because he thought there must
      have been a mistake about the address. His contention was that a
      journeyman shoemaker wasn&rsquo;t an esquire; and my contention was that
      the &ldquo;Berkeley&rdquo; was essential, and the &ldquo;Esquire&rdquo;
      accidental, which was beyond his logic, bless you, Artie; for I&rsquo;ve
      often noticed, my son, that your errand-boy is a naturally illogical and
      contradictory creature. Now, shoemakers aren&rsquo;t, you know. I&rsquo;ve
      always taken a just pride in the profession, and I&rsquo;ve always
      asserted that it develops logic; it develops logic, Artie, or else why are
      all cobblers good Liberals, I should like to know? Eh, can you tell me
      that; with all your Oxford training, sir, can you tell me that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It develops logic beyond the possibility of a doubt. Daddy; and it
      develops a good kind heart as well,&rsquo; said Arthur, smiling. ‘And it
      develops musical taste, and literary talent, and a marked predilection for
      the beautiful in art and nature. In fact, whenever I meet a good man of
      any sort, anywhere, I always begin now by inquiring which of his immediate
      ancestors can have been a journeyman shoemaker. Depend upon it, Daddy,
      there&rsquo;s nothing like leather.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There you are, poking fun at your poor old Progenitor again,&rsquo; said
      the old cobbler, with a merry twinkle in the corner of his eye. ‘If it
      weren&rsquo;t for the jelly, and the natural affections always engendered
      by shoemaking, I think I should almost feel inclined to cut you off with a
      shilling, Artie, my boy&mdash;to cut you off with a shilling. Well, Artie,
      I&rsquo;m quite convalescent now (don&rsquo;t you call it? I&rsquo;m
      afraid of my long shoemaker&rsquo;s words before you, nowadays, you&rsquo;ve
      grown so literary; for I suppose parsons are more literary than even
      shoemakers). I&rsquo;m quite convalescent now, and I think, my boy, I must
      get to work again this week, and have no more of your expensive soups and
      jellies. If I didn&rsquo;t keep a sharp look-out upon you, Artie, lad, I
      believe you&rsquo;d starve yourself outright up there at Oxford to pamper
      your poor old useless father here with luxuries he&rsquo;s never been
      accustomed to in his whole life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear simple old Progenitor, you don&rsquo;t know how utterly you&rsquo;re
      mistaken,&rsquo; cried Arthur, eagerly. &lsquo;I believe I&rsquo;m really
      the most selfish and unnatural son in all Christendom. I&rsquo;m
      positively rolling in wealth up there at Magdalen; I&rsquo;ve had my room
      papered again since you saw it last long vacation; and I live like a
      prince, absolutely like a Russian prince, upon my present income. I assure
      you on my solemn word of honour, Father, that I eat meat for lunch&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      my dinner&mdash;every day; and an egg for tea as regular as clockwork. I
      often think when I look around my palatial rooms in college, what a shame
      it is that I should let you, who are worth ten of me, any day, live any
      longer in a back street up here in London; and I won&rsquo;t allow it,
      Daddy, I really won&rsquo;t allow it from this day forth, I&rsquo;m
      determined. I&rsquo;ve come up especially to speak to you about it this
      afternoon, for I&rsquo;ve made up my mind that this abnormal state of
      things can&rsquo;t continue.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Very good word, abnormal,&rsquo;
      murmured his father.&mdash;&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve also made up my mind,&rsquo;
      Arthur said, almost firmly, for him, &lsquo;that you shall come up and
      live at Oxford. I can&rsquo;t bear having you so far away from me, now
      that you&rsquo;re weaker than you used to be, Father dear, and so often
      ailing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old shoemaker laughed aloud. &lsquo;Oh no, Artie, my boy,&rsquo; he
      said cheerily, shaking his head with a continuous series of merry
      chuckles. &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do at all, it won&rsquo;t do, I assure
      you. I may be a terrible free-thinker and all that kind of thing, as the
      neighbours say I am&mdash;poor bodies, they never read a word of modern
      criticism in their lives, heaven bless &lsquo;em&mdash;stragglers from the
      march of intellect, mere stragglers&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve too much respect
      for the cloth to bring a curate of St. Fredegond&rsquo;s into such
      disgrace as that would mean for you, Artie. You shan&rsquo;t have your
      career at Oxford spoiled by its being said of you that your father was a
      working shoemaker. What with the ready-closed uppers, and what with your
      ten shillings a week, and what with all the presents you give me, and what
      with the hire of the piano, I&rsquo;m as comfortable as ever I want to be,
      growing into a gentleman in my old age, Artie, and I even begin to have my
      doubts as to whether it&rsquo;s quite consistent in me as a good Radical
      to continue my own acquaintance with myself&mdash;I&rsquo;m getting to be
      such a regular idle do-nothing aristocrat! Go to Oxford and mend shoes,
      indeed, with you living there as a full-fledged parson in your own rooms
      at Magdalen! No, no, I won&rsquo;t hear of it. I&rsquo;ll come up for a
      day or two in long vacation, my boy, as I&rsquo;ve always done hitherto,
      and take a room in Holywell, and look in upon you a bit, accidentally, so
      as not to shame you before the scouts (who are a servile set of flunkeys,
      incapable of understanding the elevated feelings of a journeyman
      shoemaker); but I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of going to live in the place, any
      more than I&rsquo;d dream of asking to be presented at court on the
      occasion of my receiving a commission for a pair of evening shoes for the
      Queen&rsquo;s head footman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Father,&rsquo; said Arthur, smiling, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re absolutely
      incorrigible. Such a dreadful old rebel against all constituted authority,
      human and divine, I never did meet in the course of my existence, I
      believe you&rsquo;re really capable of arguing a point of theology against
      an archbishop. But I don&rsquo;t want you to come up to Oxford as a
      shoemaker; I mean you to come up and live with me in rooms of our own, out
      of college. Whenever I think of you, dear Father&mdash;you, who are so
      infinitely nobler, and better, and truer, and more really a gentleman than
      any other than I ever knew in my life&mdash;whenever I think of you,
      coming secretly up to Oxford as if you were ashamed of yourself, and
      visiting your own son by stealth in his rooms in college as if you were a
      dun coming to ask him for money, instead of the person whom he delights to
      honour&mdash;whenever I think of it, Father, it makes my cheeks burn with
      shame, and I loathe myself for ever allowing you so to bemean your own
      frank, true, noble nature. I oughtn&rsquo;t to permit it, Father, I oughtn&rsquo;t
      to permit it; and I won&rsquo;t permit it any longer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, you never would have permitted it, Artie, if I hadn&rsquo;t
      compelled you; for I&rsquo;ve got all the prudence and common sense of the
      family bottled up here in my own forehead,&rsquo; said the old man,
      tapping his bulging brow significantly. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that
      Oxford may be an excellent school for Greek and Latin, and philosophy, and
      so forth; but if you want prudence and sagacity and common-sense it&rsquo;s
      a well-known fact that there&rsquo;s nothing like the practice of making
      ready-closed uppers, sir, to develop &lsquo;em. If I&rsquo;d taken your
      advice, my boy, I&rsquo;d have come up to visit you when you were an
      undergraduate, and ruined your prospects at the very outset. No, no,
      Artie, I shall stop here, and stick to my last, my dear boy, stick to my
      last, to the end of all things.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You shall do nothing of the sort, Daddy; that I&rsquo;m determined upon,&rsquo;
      Arthur cried vehemently. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you do any more
      shoemaking. The time has come when you must retire, and devote all your
      undivided energies to the constant study of modern criticism. Whether you
      come to Oxford or stop in London, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind that you shan&rsquo;t
      do another stroke of work as long as you live. Look here, dear old Daddy,
      I&rsquo;m getting to be a perfect millionaire, I assure you. Do you see
      this fiver? well, I got that for knocking out that last trashy little song
      for Fradelli; and it cost me no more trouble to compose it than to sit
      down and write the score out on a sheet of ruled paper. I&rsquo;m as rich
      as Croesus&mdash;made a hundred and eighty pounds last year, and expect to
      make over two hundred this one. Now, if a man with that perfectly
      prodigious fortune can&rsquo;t afford to keep his own father in comfort
      and affluence, what an absolute Sybarite and gourmand of a fellow he must
      be himself.&rsquo;

    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s a lot of money, certainly, Artie,&rsquo; said the old
      shoemaker, turning it over thoughtfully: &lsquo;two hundred pounds is a
      lot of money; but I doubt very much whether it&rsquo;s more than enough to
      keep you up to the standard of your own society, up there at Oxford. As
      John Stuart Mill says, these things are all comparative to the standard of
      comfort of your class. Now, Artie, I believe you have to stint yourself of
      things that everybody else about you has at Oxford, to keep me in luxuries
      I was never used to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Dad, it&rsquo;s only of the nature of a repayment,&rsquo; cried
      Arthur, earnestly. &lsquo;You slaved and sacrificed and denied yourself
      when I was a boy to send me to school, without which I would never have
      got to Oxford at all; and you taught me music in your spare hours (when
      you had any); and I owe everything I have or am or ever will be to your
      unceasing and indefatigable kindness. So now you&rsquo;ve got to take
      repayment whether you will or not, for I insist upon it. And if you won&rsquo;t
      come up to Oxford, which perhaps would be an uncongenial place for you in
      many ways, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Daddy; I&rsquo;ll look
      out for a curacy somewhere in London, and we&rsquo;ll take a little house
      together, and I&rsquo;ll furnish it nicely, and there we shall live, sir,
      whatever you say, so not another word about it. And now I want you to
      listen to the very best thing I&rsquo;ve ever composed, and tell me what
      you think of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down to the little hired cottage piano that occupied the corner of
      the neat small room, and began to run his deft fingers lightly over the
      keys. It was the Butterfly fantasia. The father sat back in his red
      easy-chair, listening with all his ears, first critically, then
      admiringly, at last enthusiastically. As Arthur&rsquo;s closing notes died
      away softly towards the end, the old shoemaker&rsquo;s delight could be
      restrained no longer. &lsquo;Artie,&rsquo; he cried, gloating over it,
      &lsquo;that&rsquo;s music! That&rsquo;s real music! You&rsquo;re quite
      right, my boy; that&rsquo;s far and away the best thing you&rsquo;ve ever
      written. It&rsquo;s exquisite&mdash;so light, so airy, so unearthlike.
      But, Artie, there&rsquo;s more than that in it. There&rsquo;s soul in it;
      and I know what it means. You don&rsquo;t deceive your poor old Progenitor
      in a matter of musical inspiration, I can tell you. I know where you got
      that fantasia from as well as if I&rsquo;d seen you getting it. You got it
      out of your own heart, my boy, out of your own heart. And the thing it
      says to me as plain as language is just this&mdash;you&rsquo;re in love!
      You&rsquo;re in love, Artie, and there&rsquo;s no good denying it. If any
      man ever wrote that fantasia without being in love at the time&mdash;first
      love&mdash;ecstasy&mdash;tremor&mdash;tiptoe of expectation&mdash;why,
      then, I tell you, music hasn&rsquo;t got such a thing as a tongue or a
      meaning in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked at him gently and smiled, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you tell me about her, Artie?&rsquo; asked the old man, caressingly,
      laying his hand upon his son&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not now, Father; not just now, please. Some other time, perhaps, but not
      now. I hardly know about it myself, yet. It may be something&mdash;it may
      be nothing; but, at any rate, it was peg enough to hang a fantasia upon.
      You&rsquo;ve surprised my little secret, Father, and I dare say it&rsquo;s
      no real secret at all, but just a passing whiff of fancy. If it ever comes
      to anything, you shall know first of all the world about it. Now take out
      your violin, there&rsquo;s a dear old Dad, and give me a tune upon it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The father took the precious instrument from its carefully covered case
      with a sort of loving reverence, and began to play a piece of Arthur&rsquo;s
      own composition. From the moment the bow touched the chords it was easy
      enough to see whence the son got his musical instincts. Old George
      Berkeley was a born musician, and he could make his violin discourse to
      him with rare power of execution. There they sat, playing and talking at
      intervals, till nearly eight, when Arthur went out hurriedly to catch the
      last train to Oxford, and left the old shoemaker once more to his week&rsquo;s
      solitude. &lsquo;Not for much longer,&rsquo; the curate whispered to
      himself, as he got into his third-class carriage quickly; &lsquo;not for
      much longer, if I can help it. A curacy in or near London&rsquo;s the only
      right thing for me to look out for!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; GHOSTLY COUNSEL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      November came, and with it came the Pembroke fellowship examination.
      Ernest went in manfully, and tried hard to do his best; for somehow, in
      spite of the immorality of fellowships, he had a sort of floating notion
      in his head that he would like to get one, because he was beginning to
      paint himself a little fancy picture of a home that was to be, with a
      little fairy Edie flitting through it, and brightening it all delightfully
      with her dainty airy presence. So he even went so far as to mitigate
      considerably the native truculence of his political economy paper, after
      Edie&rsquo;s advice&mdash;not, of course, by making any suggestion of
      opinions he did not hold, but by suppressing the too-prominent expression
      of those he actually believed in. Max Schurz&rsquo;s name was not once
      mentioned throughout the whole ten or twelve pages of closely written
      foolscap; ‘Gold and the Proletariate&rsquo; was utterly ignored; and in
      place of the strong meat served out for men by the apostles of socialism
      in the Marylebone dancing-saloon, Ernest dished up for his examiner&rsquo;s
      edification merely such watery milk for babes as he had extracted from the
      eminently orthodox economical pages of Fawcett, Mill, and Thorold Rogers.
      He went back to his rooms, satisfied that he had done himself full
      justice, and anxiously waited for the result to be duly announced on the
      Saturday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it that piece of Latin prose, too obviously modelled upon the Annals
      of Tacitus, while the senior tutor was a confirmed Ciceronian, with the
      Second Philippic constitutionally on the brain? Was it the Greek verse,
      containing one senarius with a long syllable before the caesura in the
      fifth foot, as Herbert pointed out to his brother on the very evening when
      that hideous oversight&mdash;say rather crime&mdash;had been openly
      perpetrated in plain black and white on a virgin sheet of innocent paper?
      Was it some faint ineffaceable savour of the Schurzian economics, peeping
      through in spite of all disguises, like the garlic in an Italian ragout,
      from under the sedulous cloak of Ricardo&rsquo;s theory of rent? Was it
      some flying rumour, extra-official, and unconnected with the examination
      in any way, to the effect that young Le Breton was a person of very
      dubious religious, political, and social orthodoxy? Or was it merely that
      fortunate dispensation of Providence whereby Oxford almost invariably
      manages to let her best men slip unobserved through her fingers, and so
      insures a decent crop of them to fill up her share of the passing
      vacancies in politics, literature, science, and art? Heaven or the
      Pembroke examiners alone can answer these abstruse and difficult
      questions; but this much at least is certain, that when Ernest Le Breton
      went into the Pembroke porter&rsquo;s lodge on the predestined Saturday,
      he found another name than his placarded upon the notice board, and turned
      back, sick at heart and disappointed, to his lonely lodgings. There he
      spent an unhappy hour or two, hewing down what remained of his little
      aerial castle off-hand; and then he went out for a solitary row upon the
      upper river, endeavouring to work off his disappointment like a man, with
      a good hard spell of muscular labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie had already returned to Calcombe-Pomeroy, so in the evening he went
      to tell his misfortune to Harry Oswald. Harry was really sorry to hear it,
      for Ernest was his best friend in Oxford, and he had hoped to have him
      settled close by. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll stop up and try again for Christ
      Church in February, won&rsquo;t you, Le Breton?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,&rsquo; said Ernest, shaking his head a little gloomily; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think I will. It&rsquo;s clear I&rsquo;m not up to the Oxford standard for
      a fellowship, and I couldn&rsquo;t spend another term in residence without
      coming down upon my mother to pay my expenses&mdash;a thing she can&rsquo;t
      easily afford to do. So I suppose I must fall back for the present upon
      the Exmoor tutorship. That&rsquo;ll give me time to look about me, till I
      can get something else to do; and after all, it isn&rsquo;t a bit more
      immoral than a fellowship, when one comes to look it fairly in the face.
      However, I shall go first and ask Herr Max&rsquo;s opinion upon the
      matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m going to spend a fortnight in town in the Christmas vac,&rsquo;
      said Oswald, &lsquo;and I should like to go with you to Max&rsquo;s again,
      if I may.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest coloured up a little, for he would have liked to invite Oswald to
      his mother&rsquo;s house; and yet he felt there were two reasons why he
      should not do so; he must himself be dependent this time upon his mother&rsquo;s
      hospitality, and he didn&rsquo;t think Lady Le Breton would be perfectly
      cordial in her welcome to Harry Oswald.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, however, it was arranged that Harry should engage rooms at his
      former lodgings in London, and that Ernest should take him once more to
      call upon the old socialist when he went to consult him on the question of
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For my part, Ernest,&rsquo; said Lady Le Breton to her son, the morning
      after his return from Oxford, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not altogether sorry you
      didn&rsquo;t get this Pembroke fellowship. It would have kept you among
      the same set you are at present mixing in for an indefinite period. Of
      course now you&rsquo;ll accept Lady Exmoor&rsquo;s kind proposal. I saw
      her about it the same morning we got Hilda&rsquo;s letter; and she offers
      200L. a year, which, of course, is mere pocket money, as your board and
      lodging are all found for you, so to speak, and you&rsquo;ll have nothing
      to do but to dress and amuse yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, mother, I shall see about it. I&rsquo;m going to consult Herr
      Schurz upon the subject this morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Herr Schurz!&rsquo; said Lady Le Breton, in her bitterest tone of irony.
      ‘It appears to me you make that snuffy old German microscope man your
      father confessor. It&rsquo;s very disagreeable to a mother to find that
      her sons, instead of taking her advice about what is most material to
      their own interests, should invariably go to confer with communist
      refugees and ignorant ranters. Ronald, what is your programme, if you
      please, for this morning&rsquo;s annoyance?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald, with the fear of the fifth commandment steadily before his eyes,
      took no notice of the last word, and answered calmly, ‘You know, mother,
      this is the regular day for the mission-house prayer-meeting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The mission-house prayer-meeting! I know nothing of the sort, I assure
      you. I don&rsquo;t keep a perfect calendar in my mind of all your meetings
      and your religious engagements. Then I suppose I must go alone to the
      Waltons&rsquo; to see Mr. Walton&rsquo;s water-colours?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ll give up the prayer-meeting, if you wish it,&rsquo; Ronald
      answered, with his unvarying meekness. &lsquo;Only, I&rsquo;m afraid I
      must walk very slowly. My cough&rsquo;s rather bad this morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no,&rsquo; Ernest put in, &lsquo;you mustn&rsquo;t dream of going,
      Ronald; I couldn&rsquo;t allow you to walk so far on any account. I&rsquo;ll
      put off my engagement with Oswald, who was going with me to Herr Schurz&rsquo;s,
      and I&rsquo;ll take you round to the Waltons&rsquo;, mother, whenever you
      like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear me, dear me,&rsquo; moaned Lady Le Breton, piteously, pretending to
      wring her hands in lady-like and mitigated despair; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      do anything without its being made the opportunity for a scene, it seems.
      I shall NOT go to the Waltons&rsquo;; and I shall leave you both to follow
      your own particular devices to your heart&rsquo;s content. I&rsquo;m sorry
      I proposed anything whatsoever, I&rsquo;m sure, and I shall take care
      never to do such an imprudent thing again.&rsquo; And her ladyship walked
      in her stateliest and most chilly manner out of the freezing little
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s a great cross, living always with poor mother, Ernest,&rsquo;
      said Ronald, his eyes filling with tears as he spoke; &lsquo;but we must
      try to bear with her, you know, for after all she leads a very lonely life
      herself, because she&rsquo;s so very unsympathetic.&rsquo; Ernest took the
      spare white hand in his and smoothed it compassionately. &lsquo;My dear,
      dear Ronald,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard for you. I must
      try the best I can to make it a little easier!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together as far as the mission-house, arm in arm, for though
      in some things the two young Le Bretons were wide apart as the poles, in
      others they were fundamentally at one in inmost spirit; and even Ronald,
      in spite of his occasional little narrow sectarianisms, felt the
      underlying unity of purpose no less than Ernest. He was one of those
      enthusiastic ethereal natures which care little for outer forms or
      ceremonies, and nothing at all for churches and organisations, but love to
      commune as pure spirit with pure spirit, living every day a life of
      ecstatic spirituality, and never troubling themselves one whit about
      theological controversy or established religious constitutions. As long as
      Ronald Le Breton could read his Greek Testament every morning, and talk
      face to face in their own tongue with the Paul of First Corinthians or the
      John of the Epistles, in the solitude of his own bedroom, he was supremely
      indifferent about the serious question, of free-will and fore-knowledge,
      or about the important question of apostolical succession, or even about
      that other burning question of eternal punishment, which was just then
      setting his own little sect of Apostolic Christian Missioners roundly by
      the ears. These things seemed to his enthusiastic mind mere fading echoes
      of an alien language; all that he himself really cared for in religion was
      the constant sense of essential personal communion with that higher Power
      which spoke directly to his soul all day long and always; or the equally
      constant sense of moral exaltation which he drew from the reading of the
      written Word in its own original language. He had never BECOME an
      Apostolic Christian; he had grown up to be one, unconsciously to himself.
      &lsquo;Your son Ronald&rsquo;s religion, my dear Lady Le Breton,&rsquo;
      Archdeacon Luttrell used often to say, &lsquo;is, I fear, too purely
      emotional. He cannot be made to feel sufficiently the necessity for a
      sound practical grasp of doctrinal Christianity.&rsquo; To Ronald himself,
      he might as well have talked about the necessity for a sound practical
      grasp of doctrinal Buddhism. And if Ronald had really met a devout
      Buddhist, he would doubtless have found, after half an hour&rsquo;s
      conversation, that they were at one in everything save the petty matter of
      dialect and vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Oswald&rsquo;s lodging, Ernest found his friend ready and waiting for
      him. They went on together to the same street in Marylebone as before, and
      mounted the stair till they reached Herr Schurz&rsquo;s gloomy little
      work-room on the third floor. The old apostle was seated at his small
      table by the half-open window, grinding the edges of a lens to fit the
      brass mounting at his side; while his daughter Uta, a still good-looking,
      quiet, broad-faced South German woman, about forty or a little more, sat
      close by, busily translating a scientific book into English by alternate
      reading and consultation with her father. Harry saw the title on her page
      was &lsquo;Researches into the Embryology of the Isopodal Crustaceans,&rsquo;
      and conceived at once an immense respect for the learning and wisdom of
      the communist exile&rsquo;s daughter. Herr Schurz hardly stopped a moment
      from his work&mdash;he never allowed his numerous visitors to interfere in
      any way with his daily duties&mdash;but motioned them both to seats on the
      bare bench beside him, and waited to bear the nature of their particular
      business. It was an understood thing that no one came to see the Socialist
      leader on week days except for a good and sufficient reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk at first was general and desultory; but after a little time
      Ernest brought conversation round to its proper focus, and placed his case
      of conscience fairly before his father confessor. Was it allowable for a
      consistent socialist to accept the place of tutor to the son of a peer and
      a landowner?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For my part, Herr Schurz,&rsquo; Oswald said confidently, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      see any reason on earth, from the point of view of any political economy
      whatsoever, why Ernest shouldn&rsquo;t take the position. The question isn&rsquo;t
      how the Exmoors have come by their money, even allowing that private
      property in land is in itself utterly indefensible; which is a proposition
      I don&rsquo;t myself feel inclined unreservedly to admit, though I know
      you and Le Breton do: the real question&rsquo;s this,&mdash;since they&rsquo;ve
      got this money into their hands to distribute, and since in any case they
      will have the distribution of it, isn&rsquo;t it better that some of it
      should go into Le Breton&rsquo;s pocket than that it should go into any
      other person&rsquo;s? That&rsquo;s the way I for my part look at the
      matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What do you say to that, friend Ernest?&rsquo; asked the old German,
      smiling and waiting to see whether Ernest would detect what from their own
      standpoint he regarded as the ethical fallacy of Harry Oswald&rsquo;s
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, to tell you the truth, Herr Schurz,&rsquo; answered Ernest, in his
      deliberate, quiet way, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve envisaged the
      subject to myself from quite the same point of view as Oswald has done. I
      have rather asked myself whether it was right of a man to accept a
      function in which he would really be doing nothing worthy for humanity in
      return for his daily board and lodging. It isn&rsquo;t so much a question
      who exactly is to get certain sums out of the Exmoors&rsquo; pockets,
      which ought no doubt never to have been in them; it&rsquo;s more a
      question whether a man has any right to live off the collective labour of
      the world, and do nothing of any good to the world on his own part by way
      of repayment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That&rsquo;s it, friend Ernest,&rsquo; cried the old man, with a pleased
      nod of his big grey head; &lsquo;the socialistic Iliad in a nutshell! That&rsquo;s
      the very root of the question. Don&rsquo;t be deceived by capitalist
      sophisms. So long as we go on each of us trying to get as much as we can
      individually out of the world, instead of asking what the world is getting
      out of us, in return, there will be no revolution and no millennium. We
      must make sure that we&rsquo;re doing some good ourselves, instead of
      sponging upon the people perpetually to feed us for nothing. What&rsquo;s
      the first gospel given to man at the creation in your popular cosmogonies?
      Why, that in the sweat of his face shall he eat bread, and till the ground
      from which he was taken. That&rsquo;s the native gospel of the toiling
      many, always; your doctrines of fair exchange, and honest livelihoods, and
      free contract, and all the rest of it, are only the artificial gospel of
      the political economists, and of the bourgeoisie and the aristocrats into
      whose hands they play&mdash;the rascals!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you think I oughtn&rsquo;t to take the post?&rsquo; asked Ernest, a
      little ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t say that, Le Breton&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say that,&rsquo;
      said Herr Schurz, more quietly than before, still grinding away at his
      lens. &lsquo;The question&rsquo;s a broad one, and it has many aspects.
      The best work a man can do is undoubtedly the most useful work&mdash;the
      work that conduces most to the general happiness. But we of the
      proletariate can&rsquo;t take our choice always: as your English proverb
      plainly puts it, with your true English bluntness, &ldquo;beggars mustn&rsquo;t
      be choosers.&rdquo; We must, each in his place, do the work that&rsquo;s
      set before us by the privileged classes. It&rsquo;s impossible for us to
      go nicely discriminating between work that&rsquo;s useful for the
      community, work that&rsquo;s merely harmless, and work that&rsquo;s
      positively detrimental. How can we insure it? A man&rsquo;s a printer,
      say. There&rsquo;s a generally useful trade, in which, on the whole, he
      labours for the good and enlightenment of the world&mdash;for he may print
      scientific books, good books, useful books; and most printing, on the
      average, is useful. But how&rsquo;s he to know what sort of thing he&rsquo;s
      printing? He may be printing &ldquo;Gold and the Proletariate,&rdquo; or
      he may be printing obscurantist and retrogressive treatises by the enemies
      of humanity. Look at my own trade, again. You&rsquo;d say at first sight,
      Mr. Oswald, that to make microscopes must be a good thing in the end for
      the world at large: and so it is, no doubt; but half of them&mdash;ay,
      more than half of them&mdash;are thrown away: mere wasted labour, a good
      workman&rsquo;s time and skill lavished needlessly on some foolish rich
      man&rsquo;s caprices and amusement. Often enough, now, I make a good
      instrument&mdash;an instrument, with all its fittings, worth fifty or a
      hundred pounds. That takes a long time to make, and I&rsquo;m a skilled
      workman; and the instrument may fall into the hands of a scientific man
      who&rsquo;ll use it in discovery, in verification, in promoting knowledge,
      in lessening disease and mitigating human suffering. That&rsquo;s the good
      side of my trade. But, mark you, now,&rsquo; and the old man wiped his
      forehead rapidly with his sleeve, &lsquo;it has its bad side too. As often
      as not, I know, some rich man will buy that machine, that cost me so much
      time and trouble to make, and will buy a few dozen stock slides with it,
      and will bring it out once in a moon to show his children or a few idle
      visitors the scales on a butterfly&rsquo;s wing, or the hairs on the leg
      of a common flea. Uta sets those things up by the thousand for the dealers
      to sell to indolent dilettanti. The appetite of the world at large for the
      common flea is simply insatiable. And it&rsquo;s for that, perhaps, that I&rsquo;m
      spoiling my eyesight now, grinding and grinding and grinding at this very
      lens, and fitting the thing to an accurate fraction of a millimetre, as we
      always fit these things&mdash;we who are careful and honest workmen&mdash;to
      show an idle man&rsquo;s friends the hairs on a flea&rsquo;s fore-leg. If
      that isn&rsquo;t enough to make a man ashamed of our present wasteful and
      chaotic organisation, I should think he must be a survival from the
      preglacial epoch&mdash;as, indeed, most of us actually are!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, after all, Herr Schurz,&rsquo; said Harry, expostulating, &lsquo;you
      get paid for your labour, and the rich man is doing better by encouraging
      your skill than by encouraging the less useful skill of other workmen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes,&rsquo; cried Herr Schurz, warmly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the
      doctrine of the one-eyed economists; that&rsquo;s the capitalist way of
      looking at it; but it isn&rsquo;t our way&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t ours. Is it
      nothing, think you, that all that toil of mine&mdash;of a sensible man&rsquo;s&mdash;goes
      to waste, to gratify the senseless passing whim of a wealthy nobody? Is it
      nothing that he uselessly monopolises the valuable product of my labour,
      which in other and abler hands might be bringing forth good fruit for the
      bettering and furthering of universal humanity? I tell you, Mr. Oswald,
      half the best books, half the best apparatus, half the best appliances in
      all Europe, are locked up idle in rich men&rsquo;s cabinets, effecting no
      good, begetting no discoveries, bringing forth no interest, doing nothing
      but foster the anti-social pride of their wealthy possessors. But that isn&rsquo;t
      what friend Ernest wants to ask me about to-day. He wants to know about
      his own course in a difficult case; and instead of answering him, here am
      I, maundering away, like an old man that I am, into the generalised
      platitudes of &ldquo;Gold and the Proletariate.&rdquo; Well, Le Breton,
      what I should say in your particular instance is this. A man with the fear
      of right before his eyes may, under existing circumstances, lawfully
      accept any work that will keep him alive, provided he sees no better and
      more useful work equally open to him. He may take the job the capitalists
      impose, if he can get nothing worthier to do elsewhere. Now, if you don&rsquo;t
      teach this young Tregellis, what alternative have you? Why, to become a
      master in a school&mdash;Eton, perhaps, or Rugby, or Marlborough&mdash;and
      teach other equally useless members of prospective aristocratic society.
      That being so, I think you ought to do what&rsquo;s best for yourself and
      your family for the present&mdash;for the present&mdash;till the time of
      deliverance comes. You see, there is one member of your family to whom the
      matter is of immediate importance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ronald,&rsquo; said Ernest, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Ronald. A good boy; a socialist, too, though he doesn&rsquo;t know
      it&mdash;one of us, born of us, and only apart from us in bare externals.
      Well, would it be most comfortable for poor Ronald that you should go to
      these Exmoor people, or that you should take a mastership, get rooms
      somewhere, and let him live with you? He&rsquo;s not very happy with your
      mother, you say. Wouldn&rsquo;t he be happier with you? What think you?
      Charity begins at home, you know: a good proverb&mdash;a good, sound,
      sensible, narrow-minded, practical English proverb!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ve thought of that,&rsquo; Ernest said, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll ask
      him about it. Whichever he prefers, then, I&rsquo;d better decide upon,
      had I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do so,&rsquo; Herr Max answered, with a nod. &lsquo;Other things equal,
      our first duty is to those nearest to us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What Herr Max said was law to his disciples, and Ernest went his way
      contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr. Oswald seems a very nice young man,&rsquo; Uta Schurz said, looking
      up from the microscope slides she had begun to mount at the moment her
      regular translating work was interrupted by their sudden entry. She had
      been taking quiet glances at Harry all the while, in her unobtrusive
      fashion; for Uta had learned always to be personally unobtrusive&mdash;&lsquo;the
      prophet&rsquo;s donkey,&rsquo; those irreverent French exiles used to call
      her&mdash;and she had come to the conclusion that he was a decidedly
      handsome and manly fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Which do you like best, Uta&mdash;Oswald or Le Breton?&rsquo; asked her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Personally,&rsquo; Uta answered, &lsquo;I should prefer Mr. Oswald. To
      live always with Mr. Le Breton would be like living with an abstraction.
      No woman would ever care for him; she might just as well marry Spinoza&rsquo;s
      Ethics or the Ten Commandments. He&rsquo;s a perfect model of a socialist,
      and nothing else. Mr. Oswald has some human nature in him as well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There are two kinds of socialists,&rsquo; said Herr Max, bending once
      more over his glasses; &lsquo;the one kind is always thinking most of its
      rights; the other kind is always thinking most of its duties. Oswald
      belongs to the first, Le Breton to the second. I&rsquo;ve often observed
      it so among men of their two sorts. The best socialists never come from
      the bourgeoisie, nor even from the proletariate; they come from among the
      voluntarily déclassés aristocrats. Your workman or your bourgeois who has
      risen, and who interests himself in social or political questions, is
      always thinking, &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I have as many rights and
      privileges as these other people have?&rdquo; The aristocrat who descends
      is always thinking, &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t these other people have as
      many rights and privileges as I have?&rdquo; The one type begets
      aggressive self-assertion, the other type begets a certain gentle spirit
      of self-effacement. You don&rsquo;t often find men of the aristocratic
      class with any ethical element in them&mdash;their hereditary antecedents,
      their breeding, their environment, are all hostile to it; but when you do
      find them, mark my words, Uta, they make the truest and most earnest
      friends of the popular cause of any. Their sympathy and interest in it is
      all unselfish.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And yet,&rsquo; Uta answered firmly, &lsquo;I still prefer Mr. Oswald.
      And if you care for my opinion, I should say that the aristocrat does all
      the dreaming, but the bourgeois does all the fighting; and that&rsquo;s
      the most important thing practically, after all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Ernest was talking his future plans over with his brother
      Ronald. Would it be best for Ronald that he should take a mastership, and
      both should live together, or that he should go for the present to the
      Exmoors&rsquo;, and leave the question of Ronald&rsquo;s home arrangements
      still unsettled?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s so good of you to think of me in the matter, Ernest,&rsquo;
      Ronald said, pressing his hand gently; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t think I
      ought to go away from mother before I&rsquo;m twenty-one. To tell you the
      truth, Ernest, I hardly flatter myself she&rsquo;d be really sorry to get
      rid of me; I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a dreadful thorn in her side at
      present; she doesn&rsquo;t understand my ways, and perhaps I don&rsquo;t
      sympathise enough with hers; but still, if I were to propose to go, I feel
      sure she&rsquo;d be very much annoyed, and treat it as a serious act of
      insubordination on my part. While I&rsquo;m a minor, at least, I ought to
      remain with her; the Apostle tells us to obey our parents, in the Lord;
      and as long as she requires nothing from me that doesn&rsquo;t involve a
      dereliction of principle I think I must bear with it, though I acknowledge
      it&rsquo;s a cross, a heavy cross. Thank you so much for thinking of it,
      dearest Ernest.&rsquo; And his eyes filled once more with tears as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was finally arranged that for the present at least Ernest should
      accept Lady Exmoor&rsquo;s offer, and that as soon as Ronald was
      twenty-one he should look about for a suitable mastership, in order for
      the two brothers to go immediately into rooms together. Lady Le Breton was
      surprised at the decision; but as it was in her favour, she wisely
      abstained from gratifying her natural desire to make some more
      uncomplimentary references to the snuffy old German socialist. Sufficient
      unto the day was the triumph thereof; and she had no doubt in her own mind
      that if once Ernest could be induced to live for a while in really good
      society the well-known charms and graces of that society must finally tame
      his rugged breast, and wean him away from his unaccountable devotion to
      those horrid continental communists.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; IN THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dunbude Castle, Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s family seat, stands on the last spurs
      of the great North Devon uplands, overlooking the steep glen of a little
      boulder-encumbered stream, and commanding a distant view of the Severn Sea
      and the dim outlines of the blue Welsh hills beyond it. Behind the house,
      a castle only by courtesy (on the same principle as that by which every
      bishop lives in a palace), rises the jagged summit of the Cleave, a great
      weather-worn granite hill, sculptured on top by wind and rain into those
      fantastic lichen-covered pillars and tora and logans in which antiquarian
      fancy used so long to find the visible monuments of Druidical worship. All
      around, a wide brown waste of heather undulates and tosses wildly to the
      sky; and on the summit of the rolling moor where it rises and swells in
      one of its many rounded bosses, the antlered heads and shoulders of the
      red deer may often be seen etched in bold relief against the clear
      sky-line to the west, on sunny autumn evenings. But the castle itself and
      the surrounding grounds are not planned to harmonise with the rough
      moorland English scenery into whose midst they were unceremoniously
      pitchforked by the second earl. That distinguished man of taste, a light
      of the artistic world in his own day, had brought back from his Grand Tour
      his own ideal of a strictly classical domestic building, formed by
      impartially compounding a Palladian palace, a Doric temple, and a square
      redbrick English manor-house. After pulling down the original
      fourteenth-century castle, he had induced an eminent architect of the time
      to conspire with him in giving solid and permanent reality to this his
      awful imagining; and when he had completed it all, from portico to attic,
      he had extorted even the critical praise of Horace Walpole, who described
      it in one of his letters as a &lsquo;singular triumph of classical taste
      and architectural ingenuity.&rsquo; It still remains unrivalled in its
      kind, the ugliest great country-seat in the county of Devon&mdash;some
      respectable authorities even say in the whole of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the house an Italian garden, with balustrades of very doubtful
      marble, leads down by successive terraces and broad flights of steps to an
      artificial octagonal pool, formed by carefully destroying the whole
      natural beauty of the wild and rocky little English glen beneath. To feed
      it by fitting a conduit, the moss-grown boulders that strew the bed of the
      torrent above and below have been carefully removed, and the unwilling
      stream, as it runs into the pool, has been coerced into a long straight
      channel, bordered on either side by bedded turf, and planed off at
      measured intervals so as to produce a series of eminently regular and
      classical cascades. Even Lord Exmoor himself, who was a hunting man,
      without any pretence to that stupid rubbish about taste, did not care for
      the hopeless exterior of Dunbude Castle: he frankly admitted that the
      place was altogether too doosid artificial for the line of country. If
      they&rsquo;d only left it alone, he said, in its own native condition, it
      would have been really pretty; but as they&rsquo;d doctored it and spoilt
      it, why, there was nothing on earth to be done but just put up with it and
      whistle over it. What with the hounds, and the mortgages, and the
      settlements, and the red deer, and Goodwood, the estate couldn&rsquo;t
      possibly afford any money for making alterations down in the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog-cart was in waiting at the station to carry Ernest up to the
      castle; and as he reached the front door, Lady Hilda Tregellis strolled up
      the broad flight of steps from the garden to meet him. Lady Hilda was tall
      and decidedly handsome, as Ernest had rightly told Edie, but not pretty,
      and she was also just twenty. There was a free, careless, bold look in her
      face, that showed her at once a girl of spirit; indeed, if she had not
      been born a Tregellis, it was quite clear that she would have been
      predestined to turn out a strong-minded woman. There was nothing
      particularly delicate in Lady Hilda&rsquo;s features; they were
      well-modelled, but neither regular nor cold, nor with that peculiar stamp
      of artificial breeding which is so often found in the faces of English
      ladies. On the contrary, she looked like a perfectly self-confident
      handsome actress, too self-confident to be self-conscious, and accustomed
      to admiration wherever she turned. As Ernest jumped down from the dog-cart
      she advanced quickly to shake hands with him, and look him over critically
      from head to foot like a schoolboy taking stock of a new fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; she said, with
      an open smile upon her frank face. &lsquo;I was dreadfully afraid you
      wouldn&rsquo;t care for our proposition. Dunbude&rsquo;s the dullest hole
      in England, and we want somebody here to brighten it up, sadly. Did you
      ever see such an ugly monstrosity before, anywhere?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The country about&rsquo;s lovely,&rsquo; Ernest answered, &lsquo;but the
      house itself is certainly rather ugly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ugly! It&rsquo;s hideous. And it&rsquo;s as dull as it&rsquo;s big,&rsquo;
      said Hilda vehemently. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t think what a time we have of
      it here half the year! I&rsquo;m always longing for the season to come.
      Papa fills the house here with hunting men and shooting men&mdash;people
      without two ideas in their heads, you know, just like himself; and even
      THEY go out all day, and leave us women from morning till night to the
      society of their wives and daughters, who are exactly like them. Mr. Walsh&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      Lynmouth&rsquo;s last tutor&mdash;he was a perfect stick, a Cambridge man;
      Cambridge men always ARE sticks, I believe; you&rsquo;re Oxford, of
      course, aren&rsquo;t you? I thought so. Still, even Mr. Walsh was a little
      society, for I assure you, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him, I should never
      have seen anybody, to talk to, from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end.
      So when Mr. Walsh was going to leave us, I said to mamma, &ldquo;Why not
      ask one of the Mr. Le Bretons?&rdquo; I wanted to have somebody sensible
      here, and so I got her to let me write to your brother Ronald about the
      tutorship. Did he send you the letter? I hope you didn&rsquo;t think it
      was mine. Mamma dictated it, for I don&rsquo;t write such formal letters
      as that on my own account, I can tell you. I hate conventionality of any
      sort. At Dunbude we&rsquo;re all conventional, except me; but I won&rsquo;t
      be. Come up into the billiard-room, here, and sit down awhile; William
      will see about your portmanteau and things. Papa&rsquo;s out, of course,
      and so&rsquo;s Lynmouth; and mamma&rsquo;s somewhere or other, I don&rsquo;t
      know where; and so there&rsquo;s nobody in particular at home for you to
      report yourself to. You may as well come in here while I ring for them to
      get you some lunch ready. Nobody ever gets anything ready beforehand in
      this house. We lunched ourselves an hour ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest smiled at her volubility, and followed her quickly into the big
      bare billiard-room. He walked over to the fire and began to warm himself,
      while Hilda took down a cue and made stray shots in extraordinary angles
      at impossible cannons, all the time, as she went on talking to him.
      &lsquo;Was it very cold on the way down?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, fairly. I&rsquo;m not sorry to see the fire again. Why, you&rsquo;re
      quite an accomplished player.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There&rsquo;s nothing else to do at Dunbude, that&rsquo;s why. I practise
      about half my lifetime. So I wrote to your brother Ronald, as I was
      telling you, from mamma&rsquo;s dictation; and when I heard you were
      really coming, I was quite delighted about it. Do you remember, I met you
      twice last year, once at the Dolburys&rsquo;, and once somewhere else; and
      I thought you&rsquo;d be a very good sort of person for Dunbude, you know,
      and about as much use to Lynmouth as anybody could be, which isn&rsquo;t
      saying much, of course, for he&rsquo;s a dreadful pickle. I insisted on
      putting in my letter that he was a dreadful pickle (that&rsquo;s a good
      stroke off the red; just enough side on), though mamma didn&rsquo;t want
      me to; because I thought you ought to know about it beforehand. But you
      remember him at Marlborough, of course; he was only a little fellow then,
      but still a pickle. He always was and he always will be. He&rsquo;s out
      shooting, now, with papa; and you&rsquo;ll never get him to settle down to
      anything, as long as there&rsquo;s a snipe or a plover banging about on
      the moor anywhere. He&rsquo;s quite incorrigible. Do you play at all? Won&rsquo;t
      you take a cue till your lunch&rsquo;s ready?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, I don&rsquo;t play,&rsquo; Ernest answered, half hesitating, &lsquo;or
      at least very little.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, then you&rsquo;ll learn here, because you&rsquo;ll find nothing else
      to do. Do you shoot?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh no, never. I don&rsquo;t think it right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes, I remember. How delightful! Lady Le Breton told me all about it.
      You&rsquo;ve got notions, haven&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re a Nihilist or a
      Fenian or something of that sort, and you don&rsquo;t shoot anything but
      czars and grand dukes, do you? I believe you want to cut all our heads off
      and have a red republic. Well, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s very
      refreshing; for down here we&rsquo;re all as dull as sticks together;
      Tories, every one of us to a man; perfect unanimity; no differences of
      opinion; all as conventional and proper as the vicar&rsquo;s sermons. Now,
      to have somebody who wants to cut your head off, in the house, is really
      delightful. I love originality. Not that I&rsquo;ve ever seen anybody
      original in all my life, for I haven&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m sure it would
      be delightful if I did. One reads about original people in novels, you
      know, Dickens and that sort of thing; and I often think I should like to
      meet some of them (good stroke again; legs, legs, legs, if you please&mdash;no,
      it hasn&rsquo;t legs enough); but here, or for the matter of that, in town
      either, we never see anybody but the same eternal round of Algies, and
      Monties, and Berties, and Hughs&mdash;all very nice young men, no doubt;
      exceedingly proper, nothing against them; good shots, capital partners,
      excellent families, everything on earth that anybody could desire, except
      a single atom of personal originality. I assure you, if they were all
      shaken up in a bag together and well mixed, in evening clothes (so as not
      to tell them apart by the tweeds, you know), their own mothers wouldn&rsquo;t
      be able to separate them afterwards. But if you don&rsquo;t shoot and don&rsquo;t
      play billiards, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll ever
      find to do with yourself here at Dunbude.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don&rsquo;t you think,&rsquo; Ernest said quietly, taking down a cue,
      &lsquo;one ought to have something better to do with one&rsquo;s time than
      shooting and playing billiards? In a world where so many labouring people
      are toiling and slaving in poverty and misery on our behalf, don&rsquo;t
      you think we should be trying to do something or other in return for
      universal humanity, to whom we owe so much for our board and lodging and
      clothing and amusement?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, now, that&rsquo;s just what I mean,&rsquo; said Hilda ecstatically,
      with a neat shot off the cushion against the red and into the middle
      pocket; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s such a delightfully original way of looking at
      things, you see. We all of us here talk always about the partridges, and
      the red deer, and the turnips, and the Church, and dear Lady This, and
      that odious Lady That, and the growing insolence of the farmers, and the
      shocking insubordination of the lower classes, and the difficulty of
      getting really good servants, and the dreadful way those horrid Irish are
      shooting their kind-hearted indulgent landlords; or else we talk&mdash;the
      women especially&mdash;about how awfully bored we are. Lawn-tennis, you
      know, and dinners, and what a bad match Ethel Thingumbob has made. But you
      talk another kind of slang; I dare say it doesn&rsquo;t mean much; you
      know you&rsquo;re not working at anything very much more serious than we
      are; still it&rsquo;s a novelty. When we go to a coursing meeting, we&rsquo;re
      all on the hounds; but you&rsquo;re on the hare, and that&rsquo;s so
      delightfully original. I haven&rsquo;t the least doubt that if we were to
      talk about the Irish, you&rsquo;d say you thought they ought to shoot
      their landlords. I remember you shocked mamma by saying something like it
      at the Dolburys&rsquo;. Now, of course, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me a
      bit which is right; you say the poor tenants are starving, and papa says
      the poor landlords can&rsquo;t get in their rents, and actually have to
      give up their hounds, poor fellows; and I don&rsquo;t know which of you is
      the most to be believed; only, what papa says is just the same thing that
      everybody says, and what you say has a certain charming freshness and
      variety about it. It&rsquo;s so funny to be told that one ought really to
      take the tenants into consideration. Exactly like your brother Ronald&rsquo;s
      notions about servants!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your lunch is ready in the dining-room, sir,&rsquo; said a voice at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come back here when you&rsquo;ve finished, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; Hilda
      called after him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you how to make that cannon you
      missed just now. If you mean to exist at Dunbude at all, it&rsquo;s
      absolutely necessary for you to learn billiards.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest turned in to lunch with an uncomfortable misgiving on his mind
      already that Dunbude was not exactly the right place for such a man as he
      to live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the afternoon he saw nothing more of the family, save Lady Hilda;
      and it was not till the party assembled in the drawing-room before dinner
      that he met Lord and Lady Exmoor and his future pupil. Lynmouth had grown
      into a tall, handsome, manly-looking boy since Ernest last saw him; but he
      certainly looked exactly what Hilda had called him&mdash;a pickle. A few
      minutes&rsquo; introductory conversation sufficed to show Ernest that
      whatever mind he possessed was wholly given over to horses, dogs, and
      partridges, and that the post of tutor at Dunbude Castle was not likely to
      prove a bed of roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Seen the paper, Connemara?&rsquo; Lord Exmoor asked of one of his guests,
      as they sat down to dinner. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a moment myself to
      snatch a look at the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; yet this evening; I&rsquo;m
      really too busy almost even to read the daily papers. Anything fresh from
      Ireland?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Haven&rsquo;t seen it either,&rsquo; Lord Connemara answered, glancing
      towards Lady Hilda. &lsquo;Perhaps somebody else has looked at the papers&rsquo;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody answered, so Ernest ventured to remark that the Irish news was
      rather worse again. Two bailiffs had been murdered near Castlebar.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That&rsquo;s bad,&rsquo; Lord Exmoor said, turning towards Ernest.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s a deal of distress in the West.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A great deal,&rsquo; Ernest answered; &lsquo;positive starvation, I
      believe, in some parts of County Galway.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, not quite so bad as that,&rsquo; Lord Exmoor replied, a little
      startled. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of the landlords are actually
      starving yet, though I&rsquo;ve no doubt many of them are put to very
      great straits indeed by their inability to get in their rents.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest couldn&rsquo;t forbear gently smiling to himself at the
      misapprehension. ‘Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean the landlords,&rsquo; he said
      quickly: &lsquo;I meant among the poor people.&rsquo; As he spoke he was
      aware that Lady Hilda&rsquo;s eyes were fixed keenly upon him, and that
      she was immensely delighted at the temerity and originality displayed in
      the notion of his publicly taking Irish tenants into consideration at her
      father&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, the poor people,&rsquo; Lord Exmoor answered with a slight sigh of
      relief, as who should say that THEIR condition didn&rsquo;t much matter to
      a philosophic mind. &lsquo;Yes, to be sure; I&rsquo;ve no doubt some of
      them are very badly off, poor souls. But then they&rsquo;re such an idle
      improvident lot. Why don&rsquo;t they emigrate now, I should like to know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest reflected silently that the inmates of Dunbude Castle did not
      exactly set them a model of patient industry; and that Lady Hilda&rsquo;s
      numerous allusions during the afternoon to the fact that the Dunbude
      estates were &lsquo;mortgaged up to the eyelids&rsquo; (a condition of
      affairs to which she always alluded as though it were rather a subject of
      pride and congratulation than otherwise) did not speak very highly for
      their provident economy either. But even Ernest Le Breton had a solitary
      grain of worldly wisdom laid up somewhere in a corner of his brain, and he
      didn&rsquo;t think it advisable to give them the benefit of his own views
      upon the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There&rsquo;s a great deal of rubbish talked in England about Irish
      affairs, you know, Exmoor,&rsquo; said Lord Connemara confidently. &lsquo;People
      never understand Ireland, I&rsquo;m sure, until they&rsquo;ve actually
      lived there. Would you believe it now, the correspondent of one of the
      London papers was quite indignant the other day because my agent had to
      evict a man for three years&rsquo; rent at Ballynamara, and the man
      unfortunately went and died a week later on the public roadside. We
      produced medical evidence to show that he had suffered for years from
      heart disease, and would have died in any case, wherever he had been; but
      the editor fellow wanted to make political capital out of it, and kicked
      up quite a fuss about my agent&rsquo;s shocking inhumanity. As if we could
      possibly help ourselves in the matter! People must get their rents in
      somehow, mustn&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘People must get their rents in somehow, of course,&rsquo; Lord Exmoor
      assented, sympathetically; &lsquo;and I know all you men who are unlucky
      enough to own property in Ireland have a lot of trouble about it nowadays.
      Upon my word, what with Fenians, and what with Nihilists, and what with
      Communards, I really don&rsquo;t know what the world is coming to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Most unchristian conduct, I call it,&rsquo; said Lady Exmoor, who went in
      for being mildly and decorously religious. &lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t
      understand how people can believe such wicked doctrines as these
      communistic notions that are coming over people in these latter days.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No better than downright robbery,&rsquo; Lord Connemara answered.
      ‘Shaking the very foundations of society, I think it. All done so
      recklessly, too, without any care or any consideration.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest thought of old Max Schurz, with his lifelong economical studies,
      and wondered when Lord Connemara had found time to turn his own attention
      from foxes and fishing to economical problems; but, by a perfect miracle,
      he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the straits we&rsquo;re put to, Lady Exmoor,&rsquo;
      the Irish Earl went on, &lsquo;through this horrid no-rent business.
      Absolute poverty, I assure you&mdash;absolute downright poverty. I&rsquo;ve
      had to sell the Maid of Garunda this week, you know, and three others of
      the best horses in my stable, just to raise money for immediate
      necessities. Wanted to buy a most interesting missal, quite unique in its
      way, offered me by Menotti and Cicolari, dirt cheap, for three thousand
      guineas. It&rsquo;s quite a gem of late miniaturist art&mdash;vellum
      folio, with borders and head-pieces by Giulio Clovio. A marvellous
      bargain!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Giulio Clovio,&rsquo; said Lord Exmoor, doubtfully. &lsquo;Who was he?
      Never heard of him in my life before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never heard of Giulio Clovio!&rsquo; cried Lord Connemara, seizing the
      opportunity with well-affected surprise. &lsquo;You really astonish me. He
      was a Croatian, I believe, or an Illyrian&mdash;I forget which&mdash;and
      he studied at Rome under Giulio Romano. Wonderful draughtsman in the nude,
      and fine colourist; took hints from Raphael and Michael Angelo.&rsquo; So
      much he had picked up from Menotti and Cicolari, and, being a
      distinguished connoisseur, had made a mental note of the facts at once,
      for future reproduction upon a fitting occasion. ‘Well, this missal was
      executed for Cardinal Farnese, as a companion volume to the famous Vita
      Christi in the Towneley collection. You know it, of course, Lady Exmoor?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course,&rsquo; Lady Exmoor answered faintly, with a devout hope that
      Lord Connemara wouldn&rsquo;t question her any further upon the subject;
      in which case she thought it would probably be the safest guess to say
      that she had seen it at the British Museum or in the Hamilton Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lord Connemara luckily didn&rsquo;t care to press his advantage. ‘The
      Towneley volume, you see,&rsquo; he went on fluently&mdash;he was primed
      to the muzzle with information on that subject&mdash;&lsquo;was given by
      the Cardinal to the Pope of that time&mdash;Paul the Third, wasn&rsquo;t
      it, Mr. Le Breton?&mdash;and so got into the possession of old Christopher
      Towneley, the antiquary. But this companion folio, it seems, the Cardinal
      wouldn&rsquo;t let go out of his own possession; and so it&rsquo;s been
      handed down in his own family (with a bar sinister, of course, Exmoor&mdash;you
      remember the story of Beatrice Malatesta?) to the present time. It&rsquo;s
      very existence wasn&rsquo;t suspected till Cicolari&mdash;wonderfully
      smart fellow, Cicolari&mdash;unearthed it the other day from a descendant
      of the Malatestas, in a little village in the Campagna. He offered it to
      me, quite as an act of friendship, for three thousand guineas; indeed, he
      begged me not to let Menotti know how cheap he was selling it, for fear he
      might interfere and ask a higher price for it. Well, I naturally couldn&rsquo;t
      let such a chance slip me&mdash;for the credit of the family, it ought to
      be in the collection&mdash;and the consequence was, though I was awfully
      sorry to part with her, I was absolutely obliged to sell the Maid for
      pocket-money, Lady Hilda&mdash;I assure you, for pocket-money. My tenants
      won&rsquo;t pay up, and nothing will make them. They&rsquo;ve got the cash
      actually in the bank; but they keep it there, waiting for a set of
      sentimentalists in the House of Commons to interfere between us, and make
      them a present of my property. Rolling in money, some of them are, I can
      tell you. One man, I know as a positive fact, sold a pig last week, and
      yet pretends he can&rsquo;t pay me. All the fault of these horrid
      communists that you were speaking of, Lady Exmoor&mdash;all the fault of
      these horrid communists.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re rather a communist yourself, aren&rsquo;t you, Mr. Le
      Breton?&rsquo; asked Lady Hilda boldly from across the table. &lsquo;I
      remember you told me something once about cutting the throats of all the
      landlords.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Exmoor looked as though a bomb-shell had dropped into the
      drawing-room. &lsquo;My dear Hilda,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure
      you must have misunderstood Mr. Le Breton. You can&rsquo;t have meant
      anything so dreadful as that, Mr. Le Breton, can you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Certainly not,&rsquo; Ernest answered, with a clear conscience. &lsquo;Lady
      Hilda has put her own interpretation upon my casual words. I haven&rsquo;t
      the least desire to cut anybody&rsquo;s throat, even metaphorically.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda looked a little disappointed; she had hoped for a good rattling
      discussion, in which Ernest was to shock the whole table&mdash;it does
      people such a lot of good, you know, to have a nice round shocking; but
      Ernest was evidently not inclined to show fight for her sole
      gratification, and so she proceeded to her alternative amusement of
      getting Lord Connemara to display the full force of his own inanity. This
      was an easy and unending source of innocent enjoyment to Lady Hilda,
      enhanced by the fact that she knew her father and mother were anxious to
      see her Countess of Connemara, and that they would be annoyed by her
      public exposition of that eligible young man&rsquo;s intense selfishness
      and empty-headedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, Ernest did not enjoy his first week at the Exmoors&rsquo;. Nor
      did he enjoy the second, or the third, or the fourth week much better. The
      society was profoundly distasteful to him: the world was not his world,
      nor the talk his talk; and he grew so sick of the perpetual discussion of
      horses, dogs, pheasants, dances, and lawn tennis, with occasional
      digressions on Giulio Clovio and the Connemara gallery, that he found even
      a chat with Lady Hilda (who knew and cared for nothing, but liked to chat
      with him because he was &lsquo;so original&rsquo;) a pleasant relief, by
      comparison, from the eternal round of Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s anecdotes about
      famous racers or celebrated actresses. But worst of all he did not like
      his work; he felt that, useless as he considered it, he was not
      successfully performing even the useless function he was paid to fulfil.
      Lynmouth couldn&rsquo;t learn, wouldn&rsquo;t learn, and wasn&rsquo;t
      going to learn. Ernest might as well have tried to din the necessary three
      plays of Euripides into the nearest lamp-post. Nobody encouraged him to
      learn in any way, indeed Lord Exmoor remembered that he himself had
      scraped through somehow at Christ Church, with the aid of a private tutor
      and the magic of his title, and he hadn&rsquo;t the least doubt that
      Lynmouth would scrape through in his turn in like manner. And so, though
      most young men would have found the Dunbude tutorship the very acme of
      their wishes&mdash;plenty of amusements and nothing to do for them&mdash;Ernest
      Le Breton found it to the last degree irksome and unsatisfactory. Not that
      he had ever to complain of any unkindliness on the part of the Exmoor
      family; they were really in their own way very kind-hearted, friendly sort
      of people&mdash;that is to say, towards all members of their own circle;
      and as they considered Ernest one of themselves, in virtue of their
      acquaintance with his mother, they really did their best to make him as
      happy and comfortable as was in their power. But then he was such a very
      strange young man! &lsquo;For what on earth can you do,&rsquo; as Lord
      Exmoor justly asked, &lsquo;with a young fellow who won&rsquo;t shoot, and
      who won&rsquo;t fish, and who won&rsquo;t hunt, and who won&rsquo;t even
      play lansquenet?&rsquo; Such a case was clearly hopeless. He would have
      liked to see more of Miss Merivale, little Lady Sybil&rsquo;s governess
      (for there were three children in the family); but Miss Merivale was a
      timid, sensitive girl, and she did not often encourage his advances, lest
      my lady should say she was setting her cap at the tutor. The consequence
      was that he was necessarily thrown much upon Lady Hilda&rsquo;s society;
      and as Lady Hilda was laudably eager to instruct him in billiards, lawn
      tennis, and sketching, he rapidly grew to be quite an adept at those
      relatively moral and innocuous amusements, under her constant instruction
      and supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It seems to me,&rsquo; said that acute observer, Lord Lynmouth, to his
      special friend and confidante, the lady&rsquo;s-maid, &lsquo;that Hilda
      makes a doocid sight too free with that fellow Le Breton. Don&rsquo;t you
      think so, Euphemia?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I should hope, my lord,&rsquo; Euphemia answered demurely, &lsquo;that
      Lady Hilda would know her own place too well to demean herself with such
      as your lordship&rsquo;s tutor. If I didn&rsquo;t feel sure of that, I
      should have to mention the matter seriously to my lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the lady&rsquo;s-maid immediately stored up a mental note on
      the subject in the lasting tablets of her memory, and did not fail gently
      to insinuate her views upon the question to Lady Exmoor, as she arranged
      the pearls in the false plaits for dinner that very evening.

      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE WOMEN OF THE LAND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘Mr. Le Breton! Mr. Le Breton! Papa says Lynmouth may go out trout-fishing
      with him this afternoon. Come up with me to the Clatter. I&rsquo;m going
      to sketch there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very well, Lady Hilda; if you want my criticism, I don&rsquo;t mind if I
      do. Let me carry your things; it&rsquo;s rather a pull up, even for you,
      with your box and easel!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda gave him her sketch-book and colours, and they turned together up
      the Cleave behind the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Clatter is a peculiar Devonshire feature, composed of long loose tumbled
      granite blocks piled in wild disorder along the narrow summit of a
      saddle-backed hill. It differs from a tor in being less high and
      castellated, as well as in its longer and narrower contour. Ernest and
      Hilda followed the rough path up through the gorse and heather to the top
      of the ridge, and then scrambled over the grey lichen-covered rooks
      together to the big logan-stone whose evenly-poised and tilted mass
      crowned the actual summit. The granite blocks were very high and rather
      slippery in places, for it was rainy April weather, so that Ernest had to
      take his companion&rsquo;s hand more than once in his to help her over the
      tallest boulders. It was a small delicate hand, though Hilda was a tall
      well-grown woman; ungloved, too, for the sake of the sketching; and Hilda
      didn&rsquo;t seem by any means unwilling to accept Ernest&rsquo;s
      proffered help, though if it had been Lord Connemara who was with her
      instead, she would have scorned assistance, and scaled the great mossy
      masses by herself like a mountain antelope. Light-footed and lithe of limb
      was Lady Hilda, as befitted a Devonshire lass accustomed to following the
      Exmoor stag-hounds across their wild country on her own hunter. Yet she
      seemed to find a great deal of difficulty in clambering up the Clatter on
      that particular April morning, and move than once Ernest half fancied to
      himself that she leaned on his arm longer than was absolutely necessary
      for support or assistance over the stiffest places.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here, by the logan, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; she said, motioning him where
      to put her camp-stool and papers. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good point of view
      for the rocks yonder. You can lie down on the rug and give me the benefit
      of your advice and assistance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My advice is not worth taking,&rsquo; said Ernest. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a
      regular duffer at painting and sketching. You should ask Lord Connemara.
      He knows all about art and that sort of thing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lord Connemara!&rsquo; echoed Hilda contemptuously. &lsquo;He has a lot
      of pictures in his gallery at home, and he&rsquo;s been told by sensible
      men what&rsquo;s the right thing for him to say about them; but he knows
      no more about art, really, than he knows about fiddlesticks.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Doesn&rsquo;t he, indeed?&rsquo; Ernest answered languidly, not feeling
      any burning desire to discuss Lord Connemara&rsquo;s artistic attainments
      or deficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, he doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Hilda went on, rather defiantly, as though
      Ernest had been Lady Exmoor; &lsquo;and most of these people that come
      here don&rsquo;t either. They have galleries, and they get artists and
      people who understand about pictures to talk with them, and so they learn
      what&rsquo;s considered the proper thing to say of each of them. But as to
      saying anything spontaneous or original of their own about a picture or
      any other earthly thing&mdash;why, you know, Mr. Le Breton, they couldn&rsquo;t
      possibly do it to save their lives.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, there I should think you do them, as a class, a great injustice,&rsquo;
      said Ernest, quietly; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re evidently prejudiced against
      your own people. I should think that if there&rsquo;s any subject on which
      our old families really do know anything, it&rsquo;s art. Look at their
      great advantages.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nonsense,&rsquo; Hilda answered, decisively. &lsquo;Fiddlesticks for
      their advantages. What&rsquo;s the good of advantages without a head on
      your shoulders, I should like to know. And they haven&rsquo;t got heads on
      their shoulders, Mr. Le Breton; you know they haven&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, surely,&rsquo; said Ernest, in his simple fashion, looking the
      question straight in the face as a matter of abstract truth, &lsquo;there
      must be a great deal of ability among peers and peers&rsquo; sons. All
      history shows it; and it would be absurd if it weren&rsquo;t so; for the
      mass of peers have got their peerages by conspicuous abilities of one sort
      or another, as barristers, or soldiers, or politicians, or diplomatists,
      and they would naturally hand on their powers to their different
      descendants.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, yes, there are some of them with brains, I suppose,&rsquo; Hilda
      answered, as one who makes a great concession. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
      Herbert Alderney, who&rsquo;s member for somewhere or other&mdash;Church
      Stretton, I think&mdash;and makes speeches in the House; he&rsquo;s
      clever, they say, but such a conceited fellow to talk to. And there&rsquo;s
      Wilfrid Faunthorp, who writes poems, and gets them printed in the
      magazines, too, because he knows the editors. And there&rsquo;s Randolph
      Hastings, who goes in for painting, and has little red and blue daubs at
      the Grosvenor by special invitation of the director. But somehow they none
      of them strike me as being really original. Whenever I meet anybody worth
      talking to anywhere&mdash;in a railway train or so on&mdash;I feel sure at
      once he&rsquo;s an ordinary commoner, not even Honourable; and he is
      invariably, you may depend upon it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That would naturally happen on the average of instances,&rsquo; Ernest
      put in, smiling, &lsquo;considering the relative frequency of peers and
      commoners in this realm of England. Peers, you know, or even Honourables
      are not common objects of the country, numerically speaking.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They are to me, unfortunately,&rsquo; Hilda replied, looking at him
      inquiringly. &lsquo;I hardly ever meet anybody else, you know, and I&rsquo;m
      positively bored to death by them, and that&rsquo;s the truth, really. It&rsquo;s
      most unlucky, under the circumstances, that I should happen to be the
      daughter of one peer, and be offered promiscuously as wife to the highest
      bidder among half a dozen others, if only I would have them. But I won&rsquo;t,
      Mr. Le Breton, I really won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not going to marry a fool,
      just to please my mother. Nothing on earth would induce me to marry Lord
      Connemara, for example.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest looked at her and smiled, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda put in a stroke or two more to her pencil outline, and then
      continued her unsolicited confidences. &lsquo;Do you know, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo;
      she went on, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a conspiracy&mdash;the usual conspiracy,
      but still a regular conspiracy I call it&mdash;between Papa and Mamma to
      make me marry that stick of a Connemara. What is there in him, I should
      like to know, to make any girl admire or love him? And yet half the girls
      in London would be glad to get him, for all his absurdity. It&rsquo;s
      monstrous, it&rsquo;s incomprehensible, it&rsquo;s abominable; but it&rsquo;s
      the fact. For my part, I must say I do like a little originality. And
      whenever I hear Papa, and Uncle Sussex, and Lord Connemara talking at
      dinner, it does seem to me too ridiculously absurd that they should each
      have a separate voice in Parliament, and that you shouldn&rsquo;t even
      have a fraction of a vote for a county member. What sort of superiority
      has Lord Connemara over you, I wonder?&rsquo; And she looked at Ernest
      again with a searching glance, to see whether he was to be moved by such a
      personal and emphatic way of putting the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest looked back at her curiously in his serious simplicity, and only
      answered, &lsquo;There are a great many queer inequalities and absurdities
      in all our existing political systems, Lady Hilda.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda smiled to herself&mdash;a quiet smile, half of disappointment, half
      of complacent feminine superiority. What a stupid fellow he was in some
      ways, after all! Even that silly Lord Connemara would have guessed what
      she was driving at, with only a quarter as much encouragement. But Ernest
      must be too much afraid of the social barrier clearly; so she began again,
      this time upon a slightly different but equally obvious tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, there are; absurd inequalities really, Mr. Le Breton; very absurd
      inequalities. You&rsquo;d get rid of them all, I know. You told me that
      about cutting all the landlords&rsquo; heads off, I&rsquo;m sure, though
      you said when I spoke about it before Mamma, the night you first came
      here, that you didn&rsquo;t mean it. I remember it perfectly well, because
      I recollect thinking at the time the idea was so charmingly and
      deliciously original.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You must be quite mistaken, Lady Hilda,&rsquo; Ernest answered calmly.
      &lsquo;You misunderstood my meaning. I said I would get rid of landlords&mdash;by
      which I meant to say, get rid of them as landlords, not as individuals. I
      don&rsquo;t even know that I&rsquo;d take away the land from them all at
      once, you know (though I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s justly theirs); I&rsquo;d
      deprive them of it tentatively and gradually.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, I can&rsquo;t see the justice of that, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; Hilda
      answered carelessly. &lsquo;Either the land&rsquo;s ours by right, or it
      isn&rsquo;t ours. If it&rsquo;s ours, you ought to leave it to us for
      ever; and if it isn&rsquo;t ours, you ought to take it away from us at
      once, and make it over to the people to whom it properly belongs. Why on
      earth should you keep them a day longer out of their own?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest laughed heartily at this vehement and uncompromising
      sans-culottism. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a vigorous convert, anyhow,&rsquo; he
      said, with some amusement; &lsquo;I see you&rsquo;ve profited by my
      instruction. You&rsquo;ve put the question very plump and straightforward.
      But in practice it would be better, no doubt, gradually to educate out the
      landlords, rather than to dispossess them at one blow of what they
      honestly, though wrongly, imagine to be their own. Let all existing
      holders keep the land during their own lifetime and their heirs&rsquo;,
      and resume it for the nation after their lives, allowing for the rights of
      all children born of marriages between people now living.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all,&rsquo; Hilda answered in a tone of supreme conviction.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in favour of simply cutting our heads off once for all,
      and making our families pay all arrears of rent from the very beginning.
      That or nothing. Put the case another way. Suppose, Mr. Le Breton, there
      was somebody who had got a grant from a king a long time ago, allowing him
      to hang any three persons he chose annually. Well, suppose this person and
      his descendants went on for a great many generations extorting money out
      of other people by threatening to kill them and letting them off on
      payment of a ransom. Suppose, too, they always killed three a year, some
      time or other, pour encourager les autres&mdash;just to show that they
      really meant it. Well, then, if one day the people grew wise enough to
      inquire into the right of these licensed extortioners to their black mail,
      would you say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deprive them of it too unexpectedly. Let
      them keep it during their own lifetime. Let their children hang three of
      us annually after them. But let us get rid of this fine old national
      custom in the third generation.&rdquo; Would that be fair to the people
      who would be hanged for the sake of old prescription in the interval, do
      you think?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest laughed again at the serious sincerity with which she was ready to
      acquiesce in his economical heresies. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,&rsquo;
      he said: &lsquo;the land is the people&rsquo;s, and there&rsquo;s no
      reason on earth why they should starve a minute longer in order to let
      Lord Connemara pay three thousand guineas for spurious copies of early
      Italian manuscripts. And yet it would be difficult to get most people to
      see it. I fancy, Lady Hilda, you must really be rather cleverer than most
      people.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I score one,&rsquo; thought Hilda to herself, &lsquo;and whatever
      happens, whether I marry a peer or a revolutionist, I certainly won&rsquo;t
      marry a fool.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rsquo; she went
      on aloud, &lsquo;because I know your opinion&rsquo;s worth having. I
      should like to be clever, Mr. Le Breton, and I should like to know all
      about everything, but what chance has one at Dunbude? Do you know, till
      you came here, I never got any sensible conversation with anybody.&rsquo;
      And she sighed gently as she put her head on one side to take a good view
      of her sketchy little picture. Lady Hilda&rsquo;s profile was certainly
      very handsome, and she showed it to excellent advantage when she put her
      head on one side. Ernest looked at her and thought so to himself; and Lady
      Hilda&rsquo;s quick eye, glancing sideways for a second from the paper,
      noted immediately that he thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; she began again, more confidentially than ever,
      ‘one thing I&rsquo;ve quite made up my mind to; I won&rsquo;t be tied for
      life to a stick like Lord Connemara. In fact, I won&rsquo;t marry a man in
      that position at all. I shall choose for myself, and marry a man for the
      worth that&rsquo;s in him, I assure you it&rsquo;s a positive fact, I&rsquo;ve
      been proposed to by no fewer than six assorted Algies and Berties and
      Monties in a single season; besides which some of them follow me even down
      here to Dunbude. Papa and mamma are dreadfully angry because I won&rsquo;t
      have any of them: but I won&rsquo;t. I mean to wait, and marry whoever I
      choose, as soon as I find a man I can really love and honour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and looked hard at Ernest. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t speak much
      plainer than that,&rsquo; she thought to herself, &lsquo;and really he
      must be stupider than the Algies and the Monties themselves if he doesn&rsquo;t
      see I want him to propose to me. I suppose all women would say it&rsquo;s
      awfully unwomanly of me to lead up to his cards in this way&mdash;throwing
      myself at his head they&rsquo;d call it; but what does that matter? I WON&rsquo;T
      marry a fool, and I WILL marry a man of some originality. That&rsquo;s the
      only thing in the world worth troubling one&rsquo;s head about. Why on
      earth doesn&rsquo;t he take my hand, I wonder? What further can he be
      waiting for?&rsquo; Lady Hilda was perfectly accustomed to the usual
      preliminaries of a declaration, and only awaited Ernest&rsquo;s first step
      to proceed in due order to the second. Strange to say, her heart was
      actually beating a little by anticipation. It never even occurred to her&mdash;the
      belle of three seasons&mdash;that possibly Ernest mightn&rsquo;t wish to
      marry her. So she sat looking pensively at her picture, and sighed again
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ernest, wholly unsuspicious, only answered, &lsquo;You will do quite
      right, Lady Hilda, to marry the man of your own choice, irrespective of
      wealth or station.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda glanced up at him curiously, with a half-disdainful smile, and was
      just on the point of saying, &lsquo;But suppose the man of my own choice
      won&rsquo;t propose to me?&rsquo; However, as the words rose to her lips,
      she felt there was a point at which even she should yield to convention:
      and there were plenty of opportunities still before her, without
      displaying her whole hand too boldly and immediately. So she merely turned
      with another sigh, this time a genuine one, to her half-sketched outline.
      &lsquo;I shall bring him round in time,&rsquo; she said to herself,
      blushing a little at her unexpected discomfiture. ‘I shall bring him round
      in time; I shall make him propose to me! I don&rsquo;t care if I have to
      live in a lodging with him, and wash up my own tea-things; I shall marry
      him; that I&rsquo;m resolved upon. He&rsquo;s as mad as a March hare about
      his Communism and his theories and things; but I don&rsquo;t care for
      that; I could live with him in comfort, and I couldn&rsquo;t live in
      comfort with the Algies and Monties. In fact, I believe&mdash;in a sort of
      way&mdash;I believe I&rsquo;m almost in love with him. I have a kind of
      jumpy feeling in my heart when I&rsquo;m talking with him that I never
      feel when I&rsquo;m talking with other young men, even the nicest of them.
      He&rsquo;s not nice; he&rsquo;s a bear; and yet, somehow, I should like to
      marry him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; she said aloud, &lsquo;the sun&rsquo;s all wrong
      for sketching to-day, and besides it&rsquo;s too chilly. I must run about
      a bit among the rocks.&rsquo; (&lsquo;At least I shall take his hand to
      help me,&rsquo; she thought, blushing.) &lsquo;Come and walk with me? It&rsquo;s
      no use trying to draw with one&rsquo;s hands freezing.&rsquo; And she
      crumpled up the unfinished sketch hastily between her fingers. Ernest
      jumped up to follow her; and they spent the next hour scrambling up and
      down the Clatter, and talking on less dangerous subjects than Lady Hilda&rsquo;s
      matrimonial aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Still I shall make him ask me yet,&rsquo; Lady Hilda thought to herself,
      as she parted from him to go up and dress for dinner. &lsquo;I shall
      manage to marry him, somehow; or if I don&rsquo;t marry him, at any rate I&rsquo;ll
      marry somebody like him.&rsquo; For it was really the principle, not the
      person, that Lady Hilda specially insisted upon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE DAUGHTERS OF CANAAN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May, beautiful May, had brought the golden flowers, and the trees in the
      valley behind the sleepy old town of Calcombe Pomeroy were decking
      themselves in the first wan green of their early spring foliage. The
      ragged robins were hanging out, pinky red, from the hedgerows; the cuckoo
      was calling from the copse beside the mill stream; and the merry wee
      hedge-warblers were singing lustily from the topmost sprays of hawthorn,
      with their full throats bursting tremulously in the broad sunshine. And
      Ernest Le Breton, too, filled with the season, had come down from Dunbude
      for a fortnight&rsquo;s holiday, on his premised visit to his friend
      Oswald, or, to say the truth more plainly, to Oswald&rsquo;s pretty little
      sister Edie. For Ernest had fully made up his mind by this time what it
      was he had come for, and he took the earliest possible opportunity of
      taking a walk with Edie alone, through the tiny glen behind the town,
      where the wee stream tumbles lazily upon the big slow-turning vanes of the
      overshot mill-wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let us sit down a bit on the bank here, Miss Oswald,&rsquo; he said to
      his airy little companion, as they reached the old stone bridge that
      crosses the stream just below the mill-house; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s such a
      lovely day one feels loath to miss any of it, and the scenery here looks
      so bright and cheerful after the endless brown heather and russet bracken
      about Dunbude. Not that Exmoor isn&rsquo;t beautiful in its way, too&mdash;all
      Devonshire is beautiful alike for that matter; but then it&rsquo;s more
      sombre and woody in the north, and much less spring-like than this lovely
      quiet South Devon country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m so glad you like Calcombe,&rsquo; Edie said, with one of her
      unfailing blushes at the indirect flattery to herself implied in praise of
      her native county; &lsquo;and you think it prettier than Dunbude, then, do
      you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Prettier in its own way, yes, though not so grand of course; everything
      here is on a smaller scale. Dunbude, you know, is almost mountainous.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And the Castle?&rsquo; Edie asked, bringing round the conversation to her
      own quarter, &lsquo;is that very fine? At all like Warwick, or our dear
      old Arlingford?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, it isn&rsquo;t a castle at all, really,&rsquo; Ernest answered;
      &lsquo;only a very big and ugly house. As architecture it&rsquo;s
      atrocious, though it&rsquo;s comfortable enough inside for a place of the
      sort.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And the Exmoors, are they nice people? What kind of girl is Lady Hilda,
      now?&rsquo; Poor little Edie? she asked the question shyly, but with a
      certain deep beating in her heart, for she had often canvassed with
      herself the vague possibility that Ernest might actually fall in love with
      Lady Hilda. Had he fallen in love with her already, or had he not? She
      knew she would be able to guess the truth by his voice and manner the
      moment he answered her. No man can hide that secret from a woman who loves
      him. Yet it was not without a thrill and a flutter that she asked him, for
      she thought to herself, what must she seem to him after all the grand
      people he had been mixing with so lately at Dunbude? Was it possible he
      could see anything in her, a little country village girl, coming to her
      fresh from the great ladies of that unknown and vaguely terrible society?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lady Hilda!&rsquo; Ernest answered, laughing&mdash;and as he said the
      words Edie knew in her heart that her question was answered, and blushed
      once more in her bewitching fashion. &lsquo;Lady Hilda! Oh, she&rsquo;s a
      very queer girl, indeed; she&rsquo;s not at all clever, really, but she
      has the one virtue of girls of her class&mdash;their perfect frankness.
      She&rsquo;s frank all over&mdash;no reserve or reticence at all about her.
      Whatever she thinks she says, without the slightest idea that you&rsquo;ll
      see anything to laugh at or to find fault with in it. In matters of
      knowledge, she&rsquo;s frankly ignorant. In matters of taste, she&rsquo;s
      frankly barbaric. In matters of religion, she&rsquo;s frankly heathen. And
      in matters of ethics, she&rsquo;s frankly immoral&mdash;or rather
      extra-moral,&rsquo; he added, quickly correcting himself for the
      misleading expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I shouldn&rsquo;t think from your description she can be a very nice
      person,&rsquo; Edie said, greatly relieved, and pulling a few tall grasses
      at her side by way of hiding her interest in the subject. ‘She can&rsquo;t
      be a really nice girl if she&rsquo;s extra-moral, as you call it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;d cut one&rsquo;s throat or pick one&rsquo;s
      pocket, you know,&rsquo; Ernest went on quickly, with a gentle smile.
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got a due respect for the ordinary conventional
      moralities like other people, no doubt; but in her case they&rsquo;re only
      social prejudices, not genuine ethical principles. I don&rsquo;t suppose
      she ever seriously asked herself whether anything was right or wrong or
      not in her whole lifetime. In fact, I&rsquo;m sure she never did; and if
      anybody else were to do so, she&rsquo;d be immensely surprised and
      delighted at the startling originality and novelty of thought displayed in
      such a view of the question.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But she&rsquo;s very handsome, isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; Edie asked,
      following up her inquiry with due diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Handsome? oh, yes, in a bold sort of actress fashion. Very handsome, but
      not, to me at least, pleasing. I believe most men admire her a great deal;
      but she lacks a feminine touch dreadfully. She dashes away through
      everything as if she was hunting; and she DOES hunt too, which I think bad
      enough in anybody, and horrible in a woman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you haven&rsquo;t fallen in love with her, Mr. Le Breton? I half
      imagined you would, you know, as I&rsquo;m told she&rsquo;s so very
      attractive.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Fallen in love with HER, Miss Oswald! Fallen in love with Hilda
      Tregellis! What an absurd notion! Heaven forbid it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why so, please?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, in the first place, what would be the use of it? Fancy Lady Exmoor&rsquo;s
      horror at the bare idea of her son&rsquo;s tutor falling in love with Lady
      Hilda! I assure you, Miss Oswald, she would evaporate at the very mention
      of such an unheard-of enormity. A man must be, if not an earl, at least a
      baronet with five thousand a year, before he dare face the inexpressible
      indignation of Lady Exmoor with an offer of marriage for Lady Hilda.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But people don&rsquo;t always fall in love by tables of precedence,&rsquo;
      Edie put in simply. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible, I suppose, for a man
      who isn&rsquo;t a duke himself to fall in love with a duke&rsquo;s
      daughter, even though the duke her papa mayn&rsquo;t personally happen to
      approve of the match. However, you don&rsquo;t seem to think Lady Hilda
      herself a pleasant girl, even apart from the question of Lady Exmoor&rsquo;s
      requirements?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Oswald,&rsquo; Ernest said, looking at her suddenly, as she sat half
      hiding her face with her parasol, and twitching more violently than ever
      at the tall grasses; &lsquo;Miss Oswald, to tell you the truth, I haven&rsquo;t
      been thinking much about Hilda Tregellis or any of the other girls I&rsquo;ve
      met at Dunbude, and for a very sufficient reason, because I&rsquo;ve had
      my mind too much preoccupied by somebody else elsewhere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie blushed even more prettily than before, and held her peace, half
      raising her eyes for a second in an enquiring glance at his, and then
      dropping them hastily as they met, in modest trepidation. At that moment
      Ernest had never seen anything so beautiful or so engaging as Edie Oswald.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Edie,&rsquo; he said, beginning again more boldly, and taking her little
      gloved hand almost unresistingly in his; &lsquo;Edie, you know my secret.
      I love you. Can you love me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie looked up at him shyly, the tears glistening and trembling a little
      in the corner of her big bright eyes, and for a moment she answered
      nothing. Then she drew away her hand hastily and said with a sigh, &lsquo;Mr.
      Le Breton, we oughtn&rsquo;t to be talking so. We mustn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t
      let us. Take me home, please, at once, and don&rsquo;t say anything more
      about it.&rsquo; But her heart beat within her bosom with a violence that
      was not all unpleasing, and her looks half belied her words to Ernest&rsquo;s
      keen glance even as she spoke them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why not, Edie?&rsquo; he said, drawing her down again gently by her
      little hand as she tried to rise hesitatingly. &lsquo;Why not? tell me. I&rsquo;ve
      looked into your face, and though I can hardly dare to hope it or believe
      it, I do believe I read in it that you really might love me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; Edie answered, a tear now quivering visibly on
      either eyelash, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t ask me, please don&rsquo;t ask me. I
      wish you wouldn&rsquo;t. Take me home, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest dropped her hand quietly, with a little show of despondency that
      was hardly quite genuine, for his eyes had already told him better.
      &lsquo;Then you can&rsquo;t love me, Miss Oswald,&rsquo; he said, looking
      at her closely. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for it, very sorry for it; but I&rsquo;m
      grieved if I have seemed presumptuous in asking you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the two tears trickled slowly down Edie&rsquo;s cheek&mdash;not
      very sad tears either&mdash;and she answered hurriedly, &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t
      mean that, Mr. Le Breton, I don&rsquo;t mean that. You misunderstand me, I&rsquo;m
      sure you misunderstand me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest caught up the trembling little hand again. &lsquo;Then you CAN love
      me, Edie?&rsquo; he said eagerly, &lsquo;you can love me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie answered never a word, but bowed her head and cried a little,
      silently. Ernest took the dainty wee gloved hand between his own two hands
      and pressed it tenderly. He felt in return a faint pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then why won&rsquo;t you let me love you, Edie?&rsquo; he asked, looking
      at the blushing girl once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; Edie said, rising and moving away from the path
      a little under the shade of the big elm-tree, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very wrong
      of me to let you talk so. I mustn&rsquo;t think of marrying you, and you
      mustn&rsquo;t think of marrying me. Consider the difference in our
      positions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is that all?&rsquo; Ernest answered gaily. &lsquo;Oh, Edie, if that&rsquo;s
      all, it isn&rsquo;t a very difficult matter to settle. My position&rsquo;s
      exactly nothing, for I&rsquo;ve got no money and no prospects; and if I
      ask you to marry me, it must be in the most strictly speculative fashion,
      with no date and no certainty. The only question is, will you consent to
      wait for me till I&rsquo;m able to offer you a home to live in? It&rsquo;s
      asking you a great deal, I know; and you&rsquo;ve made me only too happy
      and too grateful already; but if you&rsquo;ll wait for me till we can
      marry, I shall live all my life through to repay you for your sacrifice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; Edie said, turning towards the path and drying
      her eyes quickly, &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t think you ought to marry me.
      The difference in station is so great&mdash;even Harry would allow the
      difference in station. Your father was a great man, and a general and a
      knight, you know; and though my dear father is the best and kindest of
      men, he isn&rsquo;t anything of that sort, of course.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight shade of pain passed across Ernest&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Edie,&rsquo;
      he said, ‘please don&rsquo;t talk about that&mdash;please don&rsquo;t. My
      father was a just and good man, whom I loved and honoured deeply; if there&rsquo;s
      anything good in any of us boys, it comes to us from my dear father. But
      please don&rsquo;t speak to me about his profession. It&rsquo;s one of the
      griefs and troubles of my life. He was a soldier, and an Indian soldier
      too; and if there&rsquo;s anything more certain to me than the principle
      that all fighting is very wrong and indefensible, it&rsquo;s the principle
      that our rule in India is utterly unjust and wicked. So instead of being
      proud of my father&rsquo;s profession, much as I respected him, I&rsquo;m
      profoundly ashamed of it; and it has been a great question to me always
      how far I was justified at all in living upon the pension given me for his
      Indian services.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie looked at him half surprised and half puzzled. It was to her such an
      odd and unexpected point of view. But she felt instinctively that Ernest
      really and deeply meant what he said, and she knew she must not allude to
      the subject again. &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; she said simply,
      &lsquo;if I&rsquo;ve put it wrong; yet you know I can&rsquo;t help feeling
      the great disparity in our two situations.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Edie,&rsquo; said Ernest, looking at her again with all his eyes&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      going to call you &ldquo;Edie&rdquo; always now, so that&rsquo;s
      understood between us. Well, I shall tell you exactly how I feel about
      this matter. From the first moment I saw you I felt drawn towards you, I
      felt that I couldn&rsquo;t help admiring you and sympathising with you and
      loving you. If I dared I would have spoken to you that day at Iffley; but
      I said to myself &ldquo;She will not care for me; and besides, it would be
      wrong of me to ask her just yet.&rdquo; I had nothing to live upon, and I
      oughtn&rsquo;t to ask you to wait for me&mdash;you who are so pretty, and
      sweet and good, and clever&mdash;I ought to leave you free to your natural
      prospect of marrying some better man, who would make you happier than I
      can ever hope to do. So I tried to put the impulse aside; I waited, saying
      to myself that if you really cared for me a little bit, you would still
      care for me when I came to Calcombe Pomeroy. But then my natural
      selfishness overcame me&mdash;you can forgive me for it, Edie; how could I
      help it when I had once seen you? I began to be afraid some other man
      would be beforehand with you; and I liked you so much I couldn&rsquo;t
      bear to think of the chance that you might be taken away from me before I
      asked you. All day long, as I&rsquo;ve been walking alone on those high
      grey moors at Dunbude, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of you; and at last I made
      up my mind that I MUST come and ask you to be my wife&mdash;some time&mdash;whenever
      we could afford to marry. I know I&rsquo;m asking you to make a great
      sacrifice for me; it&rsquo;s more than I have any right to ask you; I&rsquo;m
      ashamed of myself for asking it; I can only make you a poor man&rsquo;s
      wife, and how long I may have to wait even for that I can&rsquo;t say; but
      if you&rsquo;ll only consent to wait for me, Edie, I&rsquo;ll do the best
      that lies in me to make you as happy and to love you as well as any man on
      earth could ever do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie turned her face towards his, and said softly, &lsquo;Mr. Le Breton, I
      will wait for you as long as ever you wish; and I&rsquo;m so happy, oh so
      happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause for a few moments, and then, as they walked homeward
      down the green glen, Edie said, with something more of her usual archness,
      &lsquo;So after all you haven&rsquo;t fallen in love with Lady Hilda! Do
      you know, Mr. Le Breton, I rather fancied at Oxford you liked me just a
      little tiny bit; but when I heard you were going to Dunbude I said to
      myself, &ldquo;Ah, now he&rsquo;ll never care for a quiet country girl
      like me!&rdquo; And when I knew you were coming down here to Calcombe,
      straight from all those grand ladies at Dunbude, I felt sure you&rsquo;d
      be disenchanted as soon as you saw me, and never think anything more about
      me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you liked me, Edie?&rsquo; Ernest asked eagerly. &lsquo;You wanted
      me really to come to Calcombe to see you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course I did, Mr. Le Breton. I&rsquo;ve liked you from the first
      moment I saw you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m so glad,&rsquo; Ernest went on quickly. &lsquo;I believe all
      real love is love at first sight. I wouldn&rsquo;t care myself to be loved
      in any other way. And you thought I might fall in love with Lady Hilda?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, you know, she is sure to be so handsome, and so accomplished, and
      to have had so many advantages that I have never had. I was afraid I
      should seem so very simple to you after Lady Hilda.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Edie!&rsquo; cried Ernest, stopping a moment, and gazing at the
      little light airy figure. &lsquo;I only wish you could know the
      difference. Coming from Dunbude to Calcombe is like coming from darkness
      into light. Up there one meets with nobody but essentially vulgar-minded
      selfish people&mdash;people whose whole life is passed in thinking and
      talking about nothing but dogs, and horses, and partridges, and salmon;
      racing, and hunting, and billiards, and wines; amusements, amusements,
      amusements, all of them coarse and most of them cruel, all day long. Their
      talk is just like the talk of grooms and gamekeepers in a public-house
      parlour, only a little improved by better English and more money. Will
      So-and-so win the Derby? What a splendid run we had with the West Somerset
      on Wednesday! Were you in at the death of that big fox at Coulson&rsquo;s
      Corner? Ought the new vintages of Madeira to be bottled direct or sent
      round the Cape like the old ones? Capital burlesque at the Gaiety, but
      very slow at the Lyceum. Who will go to the Duchess of Dorsetshire&rsquo;s
      dance on the twentieth:&mdash;and so forth for ever. Their own petty round
      of selfish pleasures from week&rsquo;s end to week&rsquo;s end&mdash;no
      thought of anybody else, no thought of the world at large, no thought even
      of any higher interest in their own personalities. Their politics are just
      a selfish calculation of their own prospects&mdash;land, Church, capital,
      privilege. Their religion (when they have any) is just a selfish regard
      for their own personal future welfare. From the time I went to Dunbude to
      this day, I&rsquo;ve never heard a single word about any higher thought of
      any sort&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean only about the troubles or the
      aspirations of other people, but even about books, about science, about
      art, about natural beauty. They live in a world of amusing oneself and of
      amusing oneself in vulgar fashions&mdash;as a born clown would do if he
      came suddenly into a large fortune. The women are just as bad as the men,
      only in a different way&mdash;not always even that; for most of them think
      only of the Four-in-hand Club and the pigeon-shooting at Hurlingham&mdash;things
      to sicken one. Now, I&rsquo;ve known selfish people before, but not
      selfish people utterly without any tincture of culture. I come away from
      Dunbude, and come down here to Calcombe: and the difference in the
      atmosphere makes one&rsquo;s very breath come and go freer. And I look at
      you, Edie, and think of you beside Lady Hilda Tregellis, and I laugh in my
      heart at the difference that artificial rules have made between you. I
      wish you knew how immeasurably her superior you are in every way. The fact
      is, it&rsquo;s a comfort to escape from Dunbude for a while and get down
      here to feel oneself once more, in the only true sense of the word, in a
      little good society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were happening in the Bourne Close, palsied old Miss
      Luttrell, mumbling and grumbling inarticulately to herself, was slowly
      tottering down the steep High Street of Calcombe Pomeroy, on her way to
      the village grocer&rsquo;s. She shambled in tremulously to Mrs. Oswald&rsquo;s
      counter, and seating herself on a high stool, as was her wont, laid
      herself out distinctly for a list of purchases and a good deliberate
      ill-natured gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Two pounds of coffee, if you please, Mrs. Oswald,&rsquo; she began with a
      quaver; &lsquo;coffee, mind, I say, not chicory; your stuff always has the
      smallest possible amount of flavour in it, it seems to me, for the largest
      possible amount of quantity; all chicory, all chicory&mdash;no decent
      coffee to be had now in Calcombe Pomeroy. So your son&rsquo;s at home this
      week, is he? Out of work, I suppose? I saw him lounging about on the
      beach, idling away his time, yesterday; pity he wasn&rsquo;t at some
      decent trade, instead of hanging about and doing nothing, as if he was a
      gentleman. Five pounds of lump sugar, too; good lump sugar, though I
      expect I shall get nothing but beetroot; it&rsquo;s all beetroot now, my
      brother tells me; they&rsquo;ve ruined the West Indies with their
      emancipation fads and their differential duties and the Lord knows what&mdash;we
      had estates in the West Indies ourselves, all given up to our negroes
      nowadays&mdash;and now I believe they have to pay the French a bounty or
      something of the sort to induce them to make sugar out of beetroot,
      because the negroes won&rsquo;t work without whipping, so I understand;
      that&rsquo;s what comes in the end of your Radical fal-lal notions. Well,
      five pounds of lump, and five pounds of moist, though the one&rsquo;s as
      bad as the other, really. A great pity about your son. I hope he&rsquo;ll
      get a place again soon. It must be a trial to you to have him so idle!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, no, ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s not,&rsquo; Mrs. Oswald answered, with
      such self-restraint as she could command. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not much of a
      trial to his father and me, for we&rsquo;re glad to let him have a little
      rest after working so hard at Oxford. He works too hard, ma&rsquo;am, but
      he gets compensation for it, don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ee see, Miss Luttrell, for
      he&rsquo;s just been made a Fellow of the Royal Society&mdash;&ldquo;for
      his mathematical eminence,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; says&mdash;a
      Fellow of the Royal Society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this staggering blow did not completely crush old Miss Luttrell.
      ‘Fellow of the Royal Society,&rsquo; she muttered feebly through her
      remaining teeth. &lsquo;Must be some mistake somewhere, Mrs. Oswald&mdash;quite
      impossible. A very meritorious young man, your son, doubtless; but a
      National schoolmaster&rsquo;s hardly likely to be made a Fellow of the
      Royal Society. Oh, I remember you told me he&rsquo;s not a National
      schoolmaster, but has something to do at one of the Oxford colleges. Yes,
      yes; I see what it is&mdash;Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. You
      subscribe a guinea, and get made a Fellow by subscription, just for the
      sake of writing F.R.G.S. after your name; it gives a young man a look of
      importance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, Miss Luttrell, it isn&rsquo;t that; it&rsquo;s THE Royal Society; and
      if you&rsquo;ll wait a moment, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ll fetch you the
      president&rsquo;s letter, and the diploma, to let you see it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, no occasion to trouble yourself, Mrs. Oswald!&rsquo; the old lady put
      in, almost with alacrity, for she had herself seen the announcement of
      Harry Oswald&rsquo;s election in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; a few days
      before. &lsquo;No occasion to trouble yourself, I&rsquo;m sure; I daresay
      you may be right, and at any rate it&rsquo;s no business of mine, thank
      heaven. I never want to poke my nose into anybody else&rsquo;s business.
      Well, talking of Oxford, Mrs. Oswald, there&rsquo;s a very nice young man
      down here at present; I wonder if you know where he&rsquo;s lodging? I
      want to ask him to dinner. He&rsquo;s a young Mr. Le Breton&mdash;one of
      the Cheshire Le Bretons, you know. His father was Sir Owen Le Breton, a
      general in the Indian army&mdash;brother officer of Major Standish
      Luttrell&rsquo;s and very nice people in every way. Lady Le Breton&rsquo;s
      a great friend of the Archdeacon&rsquo;s, so I should like to show her son
      some little attention. He&rsquo;s had a very distinguished career at
      Oxford&mdash;your boy may have heard his name, perhaps&mdash;and now he&rsquo;s
      acting as tutor to Lord Lynmouth, the eldest son of Lord Exmoor, you know;
      Lady Exmoor was a second cousin of my brother&rsquo;s wife; very nice
      people, all of them. The Le Bretons are a really good family, you see; and
      the Archdeacon&rsquo;s exceedingly fond of them. So I thought if you could
      tell me where this young man is lodging&mdash;you shop-people pick up all
      the gossip in the place, always&mdash;I&rsquo;d ask him to dinner to meet
      the Rector and Colonel Turnbull and my nephew, who would probably be able
      to offer him a little shooting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There&rsquo;s no partridges about in May, Miss Luttrell,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Oswald, quietly smiling to herself at the fancy picture of Ernest seated
      in congenial converse with the Rector, Colonel Turnbull, and young
      Luttrell; &lsquo;but as to Mr. Le Breton, I DO happen to know where he&rsquo;s
      stopping, though it&rsquo;s not often that I know any Calcombe gossip,
      save and except what you&rsquo;re good enough to tell me when you drop in,
      ma&rsquo;am; for Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s stopping here, in this house, with
      us, ma&rsquo;am, this very minute.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In this house, Mrs. Oswald!&rsquo; the old lady cried with a start,
      wagging her unsteady old head this time in genuine surprise; &lsquo;why, I
      didn&rsquo;t know you let lodgings. I thought you and your daughter were
      too much of fine ladies for THAT, really. I&rsquo;m glad to hear it. I&rsquo;ll
      leave a note for him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, Miss Luttrell, we don&rsquo;t let lodgings, ma&rsquo;am, and we don&rsquo;t
      need to,&rsquo; Mrs. Oswald answered, proudly. &lsquo;Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s
      stopping here as my son&rsquo;s guest. They were friends at Oxford
      together: and now that Mr. Le Breton has got his holiday, like, Harry&rsquo;s
      asked him down to spend a fortnight at Calcombe Pomeroy. And if you&rsquo;ll
      leave a note I&rsquo;ll be very happy to give it to him as soon as he
      comes in, for he&rsquo;s out walking now with Harry and Edith.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Miss Luttrell sat for half a minute in unwonted silence, revolving in
      her poor puzzled head what line of tactics she ought to adopt under such a
      very singular and annoying combination of circumstances. Stopping at the
      village grocer&rsquo;s!&mdash;this was really too atrocious! The Le
      Bretons were all as mad as hatters, that she knew well; all except the
      mother, who was a sensible person, and quite rational. But old Sir Owen
      was a man with the most absurd religious fancies&mdash;took an interest in
      the souls of the soldiers; quite right and proper, of course, in a
      chaplain, but really too ridiculous in a regular field officer. No doubt
      Ernest Le Breton had taken up some equally extraordinary notions&mdash;liberty,
      equality, fraternity, and a general massacre, probably; and he had picked
      up Harry Oswald as a suitable companion in his revolutionary schemes and
      fancies. There was no knowing what stone wall one of those mad Le Bretons
      might choose to run his head against. Still, the practical difficulty
      remained&mdash;how could she extricate herself from this awkward dilemma
      in such a way as to cover herself with glory, and inflict another bitter
      humiliation on poor Mrs. Oswald? If only she had known sooner that Ernest
      was stopping at the Oswalds, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been so loud in
      praise of the Le Breton family; she would in that case have dexterously
      insinuated that Lady Le Breton was only a half-pay officer&rsquo;s widow,
      living on her pension; and that her boys had got promotion at Oxford as
      poor scholars, through the Archdeacon&rsquo;s benevolent influence. It was
      too late now, however, to adopt that line of defence; and she fell back
      accordingly upon the secondary position afforded her by the chance of
      taking down Mrs. Oswald&rsquo;s intolerable insolence in another fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, he&rsquo;s out walking with your daughter, is he?&rsquo; she said,
      maliciously. ‘Out walking with your daughter, Mrs. Oswald, NOT with your
      son. I saw her passing down the meadows half an hour ago with a strange
      young man; and her brother stopped behind near the millpond. A strange
      young man; yes, I noticed particularly that he looked like a gentleman,
      and I was quite surprised that you should let her walk out with him in
      that extraordinary manner. Depend upon it, Mrs. Oswald, when young
      gentlemen in Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s position go out walking with young
      women in your daughter&rsquo;s position, they mean no good by it&mdash;they
      mean no good by it. Take my advice, Mrs. Oswald, and don&rsquo;t permit
      it. Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s a very nice young man, and well brought up no
      doubt&mdash;I know his mother&rsquo;s a woman of principle&mdash;still,
      young men will be young men; and if your son goes bringing down his fine
      Oxford acquaintances to Calcombe Pomeroy, and you and your husband go
      flinging Miss Jemima&mdash;her name&rsquo;s Jemima, I think&mdash;at the
      young men&rsquo;s heads, why, then, of course, you must take the
      consequences&mdash;you must take the consequences!&rsquo; And with this
      telling Parthian shot discharged carefully from the shadow of the doorway,
      accompanied by a running comment of shrugs, nods, and facial distortions,
      old Miss Luttrell successfully shuffled herself out of the shop, her list
      unfinished, leaving poor Mrs. Oswald alone and absolutely speechless with
      indignation. Ernest Le Breton never got a note of invitation from the
      Squire&rsquo;s sister: but before nightfall all that was visitable in
      Calcombe Pomeroy had heard at full length of the horrid conspiracy by
      which those pushing upstart Oswalds had inveigled a son of poor Lady Le
      Breton&rsquo;s down to stop with them, and were now trying to ruin his
      prospects by getting him to marry their brazen-faced hussey, Jemima Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Edie returned from her walk that afternoon, Mrs. Oswald went up into
      her bedroom to see her daughter. She knew at once from Edie&rsquo;s
      radiant blushing face and moist eyes what had taken place, and she kissed
      the pretty shrinking girl tenderly on her forehead. ‘Edie darling, I hope
      you will be happy,&rsquo; she whispered significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you guess it all, mother dear?&rsquo; asked Edie, relieved that she
      need not tell her story in set words.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, darling,&rsquo; said the mother, kissing her again. &lsquo;And you
      said &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie coloured once more. &lsquo;I said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; mother, for I
      love him dearly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He&rsquo;s a dear fellow,&rsquo; the mother answered gently; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m
      sure he&rsquo;ll do his best to make you happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on in the day, Harry came up and knocked at Edie&rsquo;s door. His
      mother had told him all about it, and so had Ernest. &lsquo;Popsy,&rsquo;
      he said, kissing her also, &lsquo;I congratulate you. I&rsquo;m so glad
      about it. Le Breton&rsquo;s the best fellow I know, and I couldn&rsquo;t
      wish you a better or a kinder husband. You&rsquo;ll have to wait for him,
      but he&rsquo;s worth waiting for. He&rsquo;s a good fellow and a clever
      fellow, and an affectionate fellow; and his family are everything that
      could be desired. It&rsquo;ll be a splendid thing for you to be able to
      talk in future about &ldquo;my mother-in law, Lady Le Breton.&rdquo;
      Depend upon it, Edie dear, that always counts for something in society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie blushed again, but this time with a certain tinge of shame and
      disappointment. She had never thought of that herself, and she was hurt
      that Harry should think and speak of it at such a moment. She felt with a
      sigh it was unworthy of him and unworthy of the occasion. Truly the iron
      of Pi and its evaluations had entered deeply into his soul!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; CULTURE AND CULTURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘I wonder, Berkeley,&rsquo; said Herbert Le Breton, examining a coin
      curiously, &lsquo;what on earth can ever have induced you, with your ideas
      and feelings, to become a parson!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Le Breton, your taste, like good wine, improves with age,&rsquo;
      answered Berkeley, coldly. &lsquo;There are many reasons, any one of which
      may easily induce a sensible man to go into the Church. For example, he
      may feel a disinterested desire to minister to the souls of his poorer
      neighbours; or he may be first cousin to a bishop; or he may be attracted
      by an ancient and honourable national institution; or he may possess a
      marked inclination for albs and chasubles; or he may reflect upon the
      distinct social advantages of a good living; or he may have nothing else
      in particular to do; or he may simply desire to rouse the impertinent
      curiosity of all the indolent quidnuncs of his acquaintance, without the
      remotest intention of ever gratifying their underbred Paul Pry
      proclivities.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Le Breton winced a little&mdash;he felt he had fairly laid himself
      open to this unmitigated rebuff&mdash;but he did not retire immediately
      from his untenable position. &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; he said quietly,
      &lsquo;there are still people who really do take a practical interest in
      other people&rsquo;s souls&mdash;my brother Ronald does for one&mdash;but
      the idea is positively too ridiculous. Whenever I read any argument upon
      immortality it always seems to me remarkably cogent, if the souls in
      question were your soul and my soul; but just consider the transparent
      absurdity of supposing that every Hodge Chawbacon, and every rheumatic old
      Betty Martin, has got a soul, too, that must go on enduring for all
      eternity! The notion&rsquo;s absolutely ludicrous. What an infinite
      monotony of existence for the poor old creatures to endure for ever&mdash;being
      bored by their own inane personalities for a million aeons! It&rsquo;s
      simply appalling to think of!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Berkeley wasn&rsquo;t going to be drawn into a theological discussion&mdash;that
      was a field which he always sedulously and successfully avoided. ‘The
      immortality of the soul,&rsquo; he said quietly, &lsquo;is a Platonic
      dogma too frequently confounded, even by moderately instructed persons
      like yourself, Le Breton, with the Church&rsquo;s very different doctrine
      of the resurrection of the body. Upon this latter subject, my dear fellow,
      about which you don&rsquo;t seem to be quite clear or perfectly sound in
      your views, you&rsquo;ll find some excellent remarks in Bishop Pearson on
      the Creed&mdash;a valuable work which I had the pleasure of studying
      intimately for my ordination examination.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really, Berkeley, you&rsquo;re the most incomprehensible and mysterious
      person I ever met in my whole lifetime!&rsquo; said Herbert, dryly.
      &lsquo;I believe you take a positive delight in deceiving and mystifying
      one. Do you seriously mean to tell me you feel any interest at the present
      time of day in books written by bishops?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A modern bishop,&rsquo; Berkeley answered calmly, &lsquo;is an
      unpicturesque but otherwise estimable member of a very distinguished
      ecclesiastical order, who ought not lightly to be brought into ridicule by
      lewd or lay persons. On that ground, I have always been in favour myself
      of gradually reforming his hat, his apron, and even his gaiters, which
      doubtless serve to render him at least conspicuous if not positively
      absurd in the irreverent eyes of a ribald generation. But as to
      criticising his literary or theological productions, my dear fellow, that
      would be conduct eminently unbecoming in a simple curate, and savouring of
      insubordination even in the person of an elderly archdeacon. I decline,
      therefore, to discuss the subject, especially with a layman on whose
      orthodoxy I have painful doubts.&mdash;Where&rsquo;s Oswald? Is he up yet?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No; he&rsquo;s down in Devonshire, my brother Ernest writes me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What, at Dunbude? What&rsquo;s Oswald doing there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh dear no; not at Dunbude: the peerage hasn&rsquo;t yet adopted him&mdash;at
      a place called Calcombe Pomeroy, where it seems he lives. Ernest has gone
      down there from Exmoor for a fortnight&rsquo;s holiday. You remember,
      Oswald has a pretty sister&mdash;I met her here in your rooms last
      October, in fact&mdash;and I apprehend she may possibly form a measurable
      portion of the local attractions. A pretty face goes a long way with some
      people.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Berkeley drew a deep breath, and looked uneasily out of the window. This
      was dangerous news, indeed! What, little Miss Butterfly, has the boy with
      the gauze net caught sight of you already? Will he trap you and imprison
      you so soon in his little gilded matrimonial cage, enticing you thereinto
      with soft words and, sugared compliments to suit your dainty, delicate
      palate? and must I, who have meant to chase you for the chief ornament of
      my own small cabinet, be only in time to see you pinioned and cabined in
      your white lace veils and other pretty disguised entanglements, for his
      special and particular delectation? This must be looked into, Miss
      Butterfly; this must be prevented. Off to Calcombe Pomeroy, then, or other
      parts unknown, this very next to-morrow; and let us fight out the
      possession of little Miss Butterfly with our two gauze nets in opposition&mdash;mine
      tricked as prettily as I can trick it with tags and ends of
      art-allurements and hummed to in a delicate tune&mdash;before this
      interloping anticipating Le Breton has had time to secure you absolutely
      for himself. Too austere for you, little Miss Butterfly; good in his way,
      and kindly meaning, but too austere. Better come and sun yourself in the
      modest wee palace of art that I mean to build myself some day in some
      green, sunny, sloping valley, where your flittings will not be rudely
      disturbed by breath of poverty, nor your pretty feathery wings ruthlessly
      clipped with a pair of doctrinaire, ethico-socialistic scissors. To
      Calcombe, then, to Calcombe&mdash;and not a day&rsquo;s delay before I get
      there. So much of thought, in his own quaint indefinite fashion, flitted
      like lightning through Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s perturbed mind, as he stood
      gazing wistfully for one second out of his pretty latticed creeper-clad
      window. Then he remembered himself quickly with a short little sigh, and
      turned to answer Herbert Le Breton&rsquo;s last half-sneering innuendo.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Something more than a pretty face merely,&rsquo; he said, surveying
      Herbert coldly from head to foot; &lsquo;a heart too, and a mind, for all
      her flitting, not wholly unfurnished with good, sensible, solid mahogany
      English furniture. You may be sure Harry Oswald&rsquo;s sister isn&rsquo;t
      likely to be wanting in wits, at any rate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oswald&rsquo;s a curious fellow,&rsquo; Herbert went on, changing the
      venue, as he always did when he saw Berkeley was really in earnest;
      &lsquo;he&rsquo;s very clever, certainly, but he can never outlive his
      bourgeois origin. The smell of tea sticks about him somehow to the end of
      the chapter. Don&rsquo;t you know, Berkeley, there are some fellows whose
      clothes seem to have been born with them, they fit so perfectly and impede
      their movement so little; while there are other fellows whose clothes look
      at once as if they&rsquo;d been made for them by a highly respectable but
      imperfectly successful tailor. That&rsquo;s just what I always think about
      Harry Oswald in the matter of culture. He&rsquo;s got a great deal of
      culture, the very best culture, from the very best shop&mdash;Oxford, in
      fact&mdash;dressed himself up in the finest suit of clothes from the most
      fashionable mental tailor; but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit him naturally.
      He moves about in it uneasily, like a man unaccustomed to be clothed by a
      good workman. He looks in his mental upholstery like a greengrocer in
      evening dress. Now there&rsquo;s all the difference in the world between
      that sort of put-on culture and culture in the grain, isn&rsquo;t there?
      You may train up a grocer&rsquo;s son to read Dante, and to play
      Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Lieder, and to admire Fra Angelico; but you can&rsquo;t
      train him up to wear these things lightly and gracefully upon him as you
      and I do, who come by them naturally. WE are born to the sphere; HE rises
      to it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You think so, Le Breton?&rsquo; asked the curate with a quiet and
      suppressed smile, as he thought silently of the placid old shoemaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Think so! my dear fellow, I&rsquo;m sure of it. I can spot a man of birth
      from a man of mere exterior polish any day, anywhere. Talk as much
      nonsense as you like about all men being born free and equal&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      not. They&rsquo;re born with natural inequalities in their very nerve and
      muscle. When I was an undergraduate, I startled one of the tutors of that
      time by beginning my English essay once, &ldquo;All men are by nature born
      free and unequal.&rdquo; I stick to it still; it&rsquo;s the truth. They
      say it takes three generations to make a gentleman; nonsense utterly; it
      takes at least a dozen. You can&rsquo;t work out the common fibre in such
      a ridiculous hurry. That results as a simple piece of deductive reasoning
      from all modern theories of heredity and variation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I agree with you in part, Le Breton,&rsquo; the parson said, eyeing him
      closely; &lsquo;in part but not altogether. What you say about Oswald&rsquo;s
      very largely true. His culture sits upon him like a suit made to order,
      not like a skin in which he was born. But don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s
      due more to the individual man than to the class he happens to belong to?
      It seems to me there are other men who come from the same class as Oswald,
      or even from lower classes, but whose culture is just as much ingrained
      as, say, my dear fellow, yours is. They were born, no doubt, of naturally
      cultivated parents. And that&rsquo;s how your rule about the dozen
      generations that go to make a gentleman comes really true. I believe
      myself it takes a good many generations; but then none of them need have
      been gentlemen, in the ordinary sense of the word, before him. A
      gentleman, if I&rsquo;m to use the expression as implying the good
      qualities conventionally supposed to be associated with it, a gentleman
      may be the final outcome and efflorescence of many past generations of
      quiet, unobtrusive, working-man culture&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Le Breton smiled incredulously. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I
      do, quite,&rsquo; he answered languidly. &lsquo;I confess I attach more
      importance than you do to the mere question of race and family. A
      thoroughbred differs from a cart-horse, and a greyhound from a vulgar
      mongrel, in mind and character as well as in body. Oswald seems to me in
      all essentials a bourgeois at heart even now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But remember,&rsquo; Berkeley said, rather warmly for him, &lsquo;the
      bourgeois class in England is just the class which must necessarily find
      it hardest to throw off the ingrained traces of its early origin. It has
      intermarried for a long time&mdash;long enough to have produced a distinct
      racial type like those you speak of among dogs and horses&mdash;the
      Philistine type, in fact&mdash;and when it tries to emerge, it must
      necessarily fight hard against the innate Philistinism of which it is
      conscious in its own constitution. No class has had its inequality with
      others, its natural inferiority, so constantly and cruelly thrust in its
      face; certainly the working-man has not. The working-man who makes efforts
      to improve himself is encouraged; the working-man who rises is taken by
      the hand; the working-man, whatever he does, is never sneered at. But it&rsquo;s
      very different with the shopkeeper. Naturally a little prone to servility&mdash;that
      comes from the very necessities of the situation&mdash;and laudably
      anxious to attain the level of those he considers his superiors, he gets
      laughed at on every hand. Being the next class below society, society is
      always engaged in trying to keep him out and keep him down. On the other
      hand, he naturally forms his ideal of what is fine and worth imitating
      from the example of the class above him; and therefore, considering what
      that class is, he has unworthy aims and snobbish desires. Either in his
      own person, or in the persons of his near relations, the wholesale
      merchant and the manufacturer&mdash;all bourgeois alike&mdash;he supplies
      the mass of nouveaux riches who are the pet laughing-stock of all our
      playwrights, and novelists, and comic papers. So the bourgeois who really
      knows he has something in him, like Harry Oswald, feels from the beginning
      painfully conscious of the instability of his position, and of the fact
      that men like you are cutting jokes behind his back about the smell of tea
      that still clings to him. That&rsquo;s a horrible drag to hold a man back&mdash;the
      sense that he must always be criticised as one of his own class&mdash;and
      that a class with many recognised failings. It makes him self-conscious,
      and I believe self-consciousness is really at the root of that slight
      social awkwardness you think you notice in Harry Oswald. A working-man&rsquo;s
      son need never feel that. I feel sure there are working-men&rsquo;s sons
      who go through the world as gentlemen mixing with gentlemen, and never
      give the matter of their birth one moment&rsquo;s serious consideration.
      Their position never troubles them, and it never need trouble them. Put it
      to yourself, now, Le Breton. Suppose I were to tell you my father was a
      working shoemaker, for example, or a working carpenter, you&rsquo;d never
      think anything more about it; but if I were to tell you he was a grocer,
      or a baker, or a confectioner, or an ironmonger, you&rsquo;d feel a
      certain indefinable class barrier set up between us two immediately and
      ever after. Isn&rsquo;t it so, now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps it is,&rsquo; Herbert answered dubitatively. &lsquo;But as he&rsquo;s
      probably neither the one nor the other, the hypothesis isn&rsquo;t worth
      seriously discussing. I must go off now; I&rsquo;ve got a lecture at
      twelve. Good-bye. Don&rsquo;t forget the tickets for Thursday&rsquo;s
      concert.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Berkeley looked after him with a contemptuous smile. &lsquo;The
      outcome of a race himself,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;and not the best side
      of that race either. I was half tempted, in the heat of argument, to blurt
      out to him the whole truth about the dear gentle old Progenitor; but I&rsquo;m
      glad I didn&rsquo;t now. After all, it&rsquo;s no use to cast your pearls
      before swine. For Herbert&rsquo;s essentially a pig&mdash;a selfish
      self-centred pig; no doubt a very refined and cultivated specimen of
      pigdom&mdash;the best breed; but still a most emphatic and consummate pig
      for all that. Not the same stuff in him that there is in Ernest&mdash;a
      fibre or two wanting somewhere. But I mustn&rsquo;t praise Ernest&mdash;a
      rival! a rival! It&rsquo;s war to the death between us two now, and no
      quarter. He&rsquo;s a good fellow, and I like him dearly; but all&rsquo;s
      fair in love and war; and I must go down to Calcombe to-morrow morning and
      forestall him immediately. Dear little Miss Butterfly, &lsquo;tis for your
      sake; you shall not be pinched and cramped to suit the Procrustean measure
      of Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s communistic fancies. You shall fly free in the
      open air, and flash your bright silken wings, decked out bravely in scales
      of many hues, not toned down to too sober and quaker-like a suit of drab
      and dove-colour. You were meant by nature for the sunshine and the summer;
      you shall not be worried and chilled and killed with doses of heterodox
      political economy and controversial ethics. Better even a country rectory
      (though with a bad Late Perpendicular church), and flowers, and picnics,
      and lawn-tennis, and village small-talk, and the squire&rsquo;s
      dinner-parties, than bread and cheese and virtuous poverty in a London
      lodging with Ernest Le Breton. Romance lives again. The beautiful maiden
      is about to be devoured by a goggle-eyed monster, labelled on the back
      &ldquo;Experimental Socialism&rdquo;; the red cross knight flies to her
      aid, and drives away the monster by his magic music. Lance in rest! lyre
      at side! third class railway ticket in pocket! A Berkeley to the rescue!
      and there you have it.&rsquo; And as he spoke, he tilted with his pen at
      an imaginary dragon supposed to be seated in the crimson rocking-chair by
      the wainscotted fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I must certainly go down to Calcombe. No use putting it off any
      longer. I&rsquo;ve arranged to go next summer to London, to keep house for
      the dear old Progenitor; the music is getting asked for, two requests for
      more this very morning; trade is looking up. I shall throw the curacy
      business overboard (what chance for modest merit that ISN&rsquo;T first
      cousin to a Bishop in the Church as at present constituted?) and take to
      composing entirely for a livelihood. I wouldn&rsquo;t ask Miss Butterfly
      before, because I didn&rsquo;t wish to tie her pretty wings prematurely;
      but a rival! that&rsquo;s quite a different matter. What right has he to
      go poaching on my preserves, I should like to know, and trying to catch
      the little gold fish I want to entice for my own private and particular
      fish-pond! An interloper, to be turned out unmercifully. So off to
      Calcombe, and that quickly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down to his desk, and taking out some sheets of blank music-paper,
      began writing down the score of a little song at which he had been
      working. So he continued till lunch-time, and then, turning to the table
      when the scout called him, took his solitary lunch of bread and butter,
      with a volume of Petrarch set open before him as he eat. He was lazily
      Englishing the soft lines of the original into such verse as suited his
      fastidious ear, when the scout came in suddenly once more, bringing in his
      hand the mid-day letters. One of them bore the Calcombe postmark. &lsquo;Strange,&rsquo;
      Berkeley said to himself; &lsquo;at the very moment when I was thinking of
      going there. An invitation perhaps; the age of miracles is not yet past&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      they see spirits in a conjuror&rsquo;s room in Regent Street?&mdash;from
      Oswald, too; by Jove, it must be an invitation.&rsquo; And he ran his eye
      down the page rapidly, to see if there was any mention of little Miss
      Butterfly. Yes; there was her name on the second sheet; what could her
      brother have to say to him about her?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We have Ernest Le Breton down here now,&rsquo; Oswald wrote, &lsquo;on a
      holiday from the Exmoors&rsquo;, and you may be surprised to hear that I
      shall probably have him sooner or later for a brother-in-law. He has
      proposed to and been accepted by my sister Edith; and though it is likely,
      as things stand at present, to be a rather long engagement (for Le Breton
      has nothing to marry upon), we are all very much pleased about it here at
      Calcombe. He is just the exact man I should wish my sister to marry; so
      pleasant and good and clever, and so very well connected. Felicitate us,
      my dear Berkeley!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Berkeley laid the letter down with a quiet sigh, and folded his
      hands despondently before him. He hadn&rsquo;t seen very much of Edie, yet
      the disappointment was to him a very bitter one. It had been a pleasant
      day-dream, truly, and he was both to part with it so unexpectedly. &lsquo;Poor
      little Miss Butterfly,&rsquo; he said to himself, tenderly and
      compassionately; &lsquo;poor, airy, flitting, bright-eyed little Miss
      Butterfly. I must give you up, must I, and Ernest Le Breton must take you
      for better, for worse, must he? La reyne le veult, it seems, and her word
      is law. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s hardly the man to make you happy,
      little lady; kind-hearted, well-meaning, but too much in earnest, too much
      absorbed in his ideas of right for a world where right&rsquo;s impossible,
      and every man for himself is the wretched sordid rule of existence. He
      will overshadow and darken your bright little life, I fear me; not
      intentionally&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t do that&mdash;but by his Quixotic
      fads and fancies; good fads, honest fads, but fads wholly impracticable in
      this jarring universe of clashing interests, where he who would swim must
      keep his own head steadily above water, and he who minds his neighbour
      must sink like lead to the unfathomable bottom. He will sink, I doubt not,
      poor little Miss Butterfly; he will sink inevitably, and drag you down
      with him, down, down, down to immeasurable depths of poverty and despair.
      Oh, my poor little butterfly, I&rsquo;m sorry for you, and sorry for
      myself. It was a pretty dream, and I loved it dearly. I had made you a
      queen in my fancy, and throned you in my heart, and now I have to dethrone
      you again, me miserable, and have my poor lonely heart bare and queenless!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The piano was open, and he went over to it instinctively, strumming a few
      wild bars out of his own head, made up hastily on the spur of the moment.
      &lsquo;No, not dethrone you,&rsquo; he went on, leaning back on the
      music-stool, and letting his hand wander aimlessly over the keys; &lsquo;not
      dethrone you; I shall never, never be able to do that. Little Miss
      Butterfly, your image is stamped there too deep for dethronement, stamped
      there for ever, indelibly, ineffaceably, not to be washed out by tears or
      laughter. Ernest Le Breton may take you and keep you; you are his; you
      have chosen him, and you have chosen in most things not unwisely, for he&rsquo;s
      a good fellow and true (let me be generous in the hour of disappointment
      even to the rival, the goggle-eyed impracticable dragon monstrosity), but
      you are mine, too, for I won&rsquo;t give you up; I can&rsquo;t give you
      up; I must live for you still, even if you know it not. Little woman, I
      will work for you and I will watch over you; I will be your earthly
      Providence; I will try to extricate you from the quagmires into which the
      well-meaning, short-sighted dragon will infallibly lead you. Dear little
      bright soul, my heart aches for you; I know the trouble you are bringing
      upon yourself; but la reyne le veult, and it is not your humble servitor&rsquo;s
      business to interfere with your royal pleasure. Still, you are mine, for I
      am yours; yours, body and soul; what else have I to live for? The dear old
      Progenitor can&rsquo;t be with us many years longer; and when he is gone
      there will be nothing left me but to watch over little Miss Butterfly and
      her Don Quixote of a future husband. A man can&rsquo;t work and slave and
      compose sonatas for himself alone&mdash;the idea&rsquo;s disgusting,
      piggish, worthy only of Herbert Le Breton; I must do what I can for the
      little queen, and for her balloon-navigating Utopian Ernest. Thank heaven,
      no law prevents you from loving in your own heart the one woman whom you
      have once loved, no matter who may chance to marry her. Go, day-dream,
      fly, vanish, evaporate; the solid core remains still&mdash;my heart, and
      little Miss Butterfly. I have loved her once, and I shall love her, I
      shall love her for ever!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He crumpled the letter up in his fingers, and flung it half angrily into
      the waste-paper basket, as though it were the embodied day-dream he was
      mentally apostrophising. It was sermon-day, and he had to write his
      discourse that very afternoon. A quaint idea seized him. ‘Aha,&rsquo; he
      said, almost gaily, in his volatile irresponsible fashion, ‘I have my text
      ready; the hour brings it to me unsought; a quip, a quip! I shall preach
      on the Pool of Bethesda: &ldquo;While I am coming, another steppeth down
      before me.&rdquo; The verse seems as if it were made on purpose for me;
      what a pity nobody else will understand it!&rsquo; And he smiled quietly
      at the conceit, as he got the scented sheets of sermon-paper out of his
      little sandalwood davenport. For Arthur Berkeley was one of those
      curiously compounded natures which can hardly ever be perfectly serious,
      and which can enjoy a quaintness or a neat literary allusion even at a
      moment of the bitterest personal disappointment. He could solace himself
      for a minute for the loss of Edie by choosing a text for his Sunday&rsquo;s
      sermon with a prettily-turned epigram on his own position.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE MORE EXCELLENT WAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the very top of the winding footpath cut deeply into the sandstone side
      of the East Cliff Hill at Hastings, a wooden seat, set a little back from
      the road, invites the panting climber to rest for five minutes after his
      steep ascent from the primitive fisher village of Old Hastings, which
      nestles warmly in the narrow sun-smitten gulley at his feet. On this seat,
      one bright July morning, Herbert Le Breton lay at half length, basking in
      the brilliant open sunshine and evidently waiting for somebody whom he
      expected to arrive by the side path from the All Saints&rsquo; Valley.
      Even the old coastguardsman, plodding his daily round over to
      Ecclesbourne, noticed the obvious expectation implied in his attentive
      attitude, and ventured to remark, in his cheery familiar fashion, &lsquo;She
      won&rsquo;t be long a-comin&rsquo; now, sir, you may depend upon it: the
      gals is sure to be out early of a fine mornin&rsquo; like this &lsquo;ere.&rsquo;
      Herbert stuck his double eye-glass gingerly upon the tip of his nose, and
      surveyed the bluff old sailor through it with a stony British stare of
      mingled surprise and indignation, which drove the poor man hastily off,
      with a few muttered observations about some people being so confounded
      stuck up that they didn&rsquo;t even understand the point of a little
      good-natured seafarin&rsquo; banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the coastguardsman disappeared round the corner of the flagstaff, a
      young girl came suddenly into sight by the jutting edge of sandstone bluff
      near the High Wickham; and Herbert, jumping up at once from his reclining
      posture, raised his bat to her with stately politeness, and moved forward
      in his courtly graceful manner to meet her as she approached. &lsquo;Well,
      Selah,&rsquo; he said, taking her hand a little warmly (judged at least by
      Herbert Le Breton&rsquo;s usual standard), &lsquo;so you&rsquo;ve come at
      last! I&rsquo;ve been waiting here for you for fully half an hour. You
      see, I&rsquo;ve come down to Hastings again as I promised, the very first
      moment I could possibly get away from my pressing duties at Oxford.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl withdrew her hand from his, blushing deeply, but looking into his
      face with evident pleasure and admiration. She was tall and handsome, with
      a certain dashing air of queenliness about her, too; and she was dressed
      in a brave, outspoken sort of finery, which, though cheap enough in its
      way, was neither common nor wholly wanting in a touch of native good taste
      and even bold refinement of contrast and harmony. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very
      kind of you to come, Mr. Walters,&rsquo; she answered in a firm but
      delicate voice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting. I
      got your letter, and tried to come in time; but father he&rsquo;s been
      more aggravating than usual, almost, this morning, and kept saying he&rsquo;d
      like to know what on earth a young woman could want to go out walking for,
      instead of stopping at home at her work and minding her Bible like a
      proper Christian. In HIS time young women usen&rsquo;t to be allowed to go
      walking except on Sundays, and then only to chapel or Bible class. So I&rsquo;ve
      not been able to get away till this very minute, with all this bundle of
      tracts, too, to give to the excursionists on the way. Father feels a most
      incomprehensible interest, somehow, in the future happiness of the Sunday
      excursionists.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wish he&rsquo;d feel a little more interest in the present happiness of
      his own daughter,&rsquo; Herbert said smiling. &lsquo;But it hasn&rsquo;t
      mattered your keeping me waiting here, Selah. Of course I&rsquo;d have
      enjoyed it all far better in your society&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I need
      tell you that now, dear&mdash;but the sunshine, and the sea breeze, and
      the song of the larks, and the plash of the waves below, and the shouts of
      the fishermen down there on the beach mending their nets and putting out
      their smacks, have all been so delightful after our humdrum round of daily
      life at Oxford, that I only wanted your presence here to make it all into
      a perfect paradise.&mdash;Why, Selah, how pretty you look in that sweet
      print! It suits your complexion admirably. I never saw you wear anything
      before so perfectly becoming.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah drew herself up with the conscious pride of an unaffected pretty
      girl. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you think so, Mr. Walters,&rsquo; she said,
      playing nervously with the handle of her dark-blue parasol. &lsquo;You
      always say such very flattering things.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, not flattering,&rsquo; Herbert answered, smiling; &lsquo;not
      flattering, Selah, simply truthful. You always extort the truth from me
      with your sweet face, Selah. Nobody can look at it and not forget the
      stupid conventions of ordinary society. But please, dear, don&rsquo;t call
      me Mr. Walters. Call me Herbert. You always do, you know, when you write
      to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it&rsquo;s so much harder to do it to your face, Mr. Walters,&rsquo;
      Selah said, again blushing. &lsquo;Every time you go away I say to myself,
      &ldquo;I shall call him Herbert as soon as ever he comes back again;&rdquo;
      and every time you come back, I feel too much afraid of you, the moment I
      see you, ever to do it. And yet of course I ought to, you know, for when
      we&rsquo;re married, why, naturally, then I shall have to learn to call
      you Herbert, shan&rsquo;t I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You will, I suppose,&rsquo; Herbert answered, rather chillily: &lsquo;but
      that subject is one upon which we shall be able to form a better opinion
      when the time comes for actually deciding it. Meanwhile, I want you to
      call me Herbert, if you please, as a personal favour and a mark of
      confidence. Suppose I were to go on calling you Miss Briggs all the time!
      a pretty sort of thing that would be! what inference would you draw as to
      the depth of my affection? Well, now, Selah, how have these dreadful home
      authorities of yours been treating you, my dear girl, all the time since I
      last saw you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Much the same as usual, Mr. Walters&mdash;Herbert, I mean,&rsquo; Selah
      answered, hastily correcting herself. &lsquo;The regular round. Prayers;
      clean the shop; breakfast, with a chapter; serve in the shop all morning;
      dinner, with a chapter; serve in the shop all afternoon; tea, with a
      chapter; prayer meeting in the evening; supper, with a chapter;
      exhortation; and go to bed, sick of it all, to get up next morning and
      repeat the entire performance da capo, as they always say in the music to
      the hymn-books. Occasional relaxations,&mdash;Sunday at chapel three
      times, and Wednesday evening Bible class; mothers&rsquo; assembly, Dorcas
      society, missionary meeting, lecture on the Holy Land, dissolving views of
      Jerusalem, and Primitive Methodist district conference in the Mahanaim
      Jubilee meeting hall. Salvation privileges every day and all the year
      round, till I&rsquo;m ready to drop with it, and begin to wish I&rsquo;d
      only been lucky enough to have been born one of those happy benighted
      little pagans in a heathen land where they don&rsquo;t know the value of
      the precious Sabbath, and haven&rsquo;t yet been taught to build Primitive
      Methodist district chapels for crushing the lives out of their sons and
      daughters!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert smiled a gentle smile of calm superiority at this vehement
      outburst of natural irreligion. &lsquo;You must certainly be bored to
      death with it all, Selah,&rsquo; he said, laughingly. &lsquo;What a funny
      sort of creed it really is, after all, for rational beings! Who on earth
      could believe that the religion these people use to render your life so
      absolutely miserable is meant for the same thing as the one that makes my
      poor dear brother Ronald so perfectly and inexpressibly serene and happy?
      The formalism of lower natures, like your father&rsquo;s, has turned it
      into a machine for crushing all the spontaneity out of your existence.
      What a régime for a high-spirited girl like you to be compelled to live
      under, Selah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is, it is!&rsquo; Selah answered, vehemently. &lsquo;I wish you could
      only see the way father goes on at me all the time about chapel, and so
      on, Mr. Wal&mdash;Herbert, I mean. You wouldn&rsquo;t wonder, if you were
      to hear him, at my being anxious for the time to come when you can leave
      Oxford and we can get comfortably married. What between the drudgery of
      the shop and the drudgery of the chapel my life&rsquo;s positively getting
      almost worn out of me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert took her hand in his, quietly. It was not a very small hand, but
      it was prettily, though cheaply, gloved, and the plain silver bracelet
      that encircled the wrist, though simple and inexpensive, was not wanting
      in rough tastefulness. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a bad philosopher, Selah,&rsquo;
      he said, turning with her along the path towards Ecclesbourne; ‘you&rsquo;re
      always anxious to hurry on too fast the lagging wheels of an unknown
      future. After all, how do you know whether we should be any the happier if
      we were really and truly married? Don&rsquo;t you know what Swinburne
      says, in &ldquo;Dolores&rdquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;ve read it in the Poems and
      Ballads I gave you&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Time turns the old days to derision,
      Our loves into corpses or wives,
    And marriage and death and division
      Make barren our lives?&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ve read it,&rsquo; Selah answered, carelessly, &lsquo;and I
      thought it all very pretty. Of course Swinburne always is very pretty: but
      I&rsquo;m sure I never try to discover what on earth he means by it. I
      suppose father would say I don&rsquo;t read him tearfully and prayerfully&mdash;at
      any rate, I&rsquo;m quite sure I never understand what he&rsquo;s driving
      at.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And yet he&rsquo;s worth understanding,&rsquo; Herbert answered in his
      clear musical voice&mdash;&lsquo;well worth understanding, Selah,
      especially for you, dearest. If, in imitation of obsolete fashions, you
      wished to read a few verses of some improving volume every night and
      morning, as a sort of becoming religious exercise in the elements of
      self-culture, I don&rsquo;t know that I could recommend you a better book
      to begin upon than the Poems and Ballads. Don&rsquo;t you see the moral of
      those four lines I&rsquo;ve just quoted to you? Why should we wish to
      change from anything so free and delightful and poetical as lovers into
      anything so fettered, and commonplace, and prosaic, and BANAL, as wives
      and husbands? Why should we wish to give up the fanciful paradise of
      fluttering hope and expectation for the dreary reality of housekeeping and
      cold mutton on Mondays? Why should we not be satisfied with the real
      pleasure of the passing moment, without for ever torturing our souls about
      the imaginary but delusive pleasure of the unrealisable, impossible
      future?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But we MUST get married some time or other, Herbert,&rsquo; Selah said,
      turning her big eyes full upon him with a doubtful look of interrogation.
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go on courting in this way for ever and ever,
      without coming to any definite conclusion. We MUST get married by-and-by,
      now mustn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Je n&rsquo;en vois pas la nécessité, moi,&rsquo; Herbert answered with
      just a trace of cynicism in his curling lip. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any
      MUST about it, that is to say, in English, Selah. The fact is, you see, I&rsquo;m
      above all things a philosopher; you&rsquo;re a philosopher, too, but only
      an instinctive one, and I want to make your instinctive philosophy assume
      a rather more rational and extrinsic shape. Why should we really be in any
      hurry to go and get married? Do the actual married people of our
      acquaintance, as a matter of fact, seem so very much more ethereally happy&mdash;with
      their eight children to be washed and dressed and schooled daily, for
      example&mdash;than the lovers, like you and me, who walk arm-in-arm out
      here in the sunshine, and haven&rsquo;t yet got over their delicious first
      illusions? Depend upon it, the longer you can keep your illusions the
      better. You haven&rsquo;t read Aristotle in all probability; but as
      Aristotle would put it, it isn&rsquo;t the end that is anything in
      love-making, it&rsquo;s the energy, the active pursuit, the momentary
      enjoyment of it. I suppose we shall have to get married some day, Selah,
      though I don&rsquo;t know when; but I confess to you I don&rsquo;t look
      forward to the day quite so rapturously as you do. Shall we feel more the
      thrill of possession, do you think, than I feel it now when I hold your
      hand in mine, so, and catch the beating of your pulse in your veins, even
      through the fingers of your pretty little glove? Shall we look deeper into
      one another&rsquo;s eyes and hearts than I look now into the very inmost
      depths of yours? Shall we drink in more fully the essence of love than
      when I touch your lips here&mdash;one moment, Selah, the gorse is very
      deep here&mdash;now don&rsquo;t be foolish&mdash;ah, there, what&rsquo;s
      the use of philosophising, tell me, by the side of that? Come over here to
      the bench, Selah, by the edge of the cliff; look down yonder into
      Ecclesbourne glen; hear the waves dashing on the shore below, and your own
      heart beating against your bosom within&mdash;and then ask yourself what&rsquo;s
      the good of living in any moment, in any moment but the present.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah turned her great eyes admiringly upon him once more. &lsquo;Oh,
      Herbert,&rsquo; she said, looking at him with a clever uneducated girl&rsquo;s
      unfeigned and undisguised admiration for any cultivated gentleman who
      takes the trouble to draw out her higher self. &lsquo;Oh, Herbert, how can
      you talk so beautifully to me, and then ask me why it is I&rsquo;m longing
      for the day to come when I can be really and truly married to you? Do you
      think I don&rsquo;t feel the difference between spending my life with such
      a man as you, and spending it for years and years together with a ranting,
      canting Primitive Methodist?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert smiled to himself a quiet, unobtrusive, self-satisfied smile.
      &lsquo;She appreciates me,&rsquo; he thought silently in his own heart,
      ‘she appreciates me at my true worth; and, after all, that&rsquo;s a great
      thing. Well, Selah,&rsquo; he went on aloud, toying unreproved with her
      pretty little silver bracelet, &lsquo;let us be practical. You belong to a
      business family and you know the necessity for being practical. There&rsquo;s
      a great deal to be said in favour of my hanging on at Oxford a little
      longer. I must get a situation somewhere else as soon as possible, in
      which I can get married; but I can&rsquo;t give up my fellowship without
      having found something else to do which would enable me to put my wife in
      the position I should like her to occupy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A very small income would do for me, with you, Herbert,&rsquo; Selah put
      in eagerly. &lsquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve been brought up economically
      enough, heaven knows, and I could live extremely well on very little.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But <i>I</i> could not, Selah,&rsquo; Herbert answered, in his colder
      tone. ‘Pardon me, but I could not. I&rsquo;ve been accustomed to a certain
      amount of comfort, not to say luxury, which I couldn&rsquo;t readily do
      without. And then, you know, dear,&rsquo; he added, seeing a certain cloud
      gathering dimly on Selah&rsquo;s forehead, &lsquo;I want to make my wife a
      real lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah looked at him tenderly, and gave the hand she hold in hers a faint
      pressure. And then Herbert began to talk about the waves, and the cliffs,
      and the sun, and the great red sails, and to quote Shelley and Swinburne;
      and the conversation glided off into more ordinary everyday topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat for a couple of hours together on the edge of the cliff, talking
      to one another about such and other subjects, till, at last, Selah asked
      the time, hurriedly, and declared she must go off at once, or father&rsquo;d
      be in a tearing passion. Herbert walked back with her through the green
      lanes in the golden mass of gorse, till he reached the brow of the hill by
      the fisher village. Then Selah said lightly, &lsquo;Not any nearer,
      Herbert&mdash;you see I can say Herbert quite naturally now&mdash;the
      neighbours will go talking about it if they see me standing here with a
      strange gentleman. Good-bye, good-bye, till Friday.&rsquo; Herbert held
      her face up to his in his hands, and kissed her twice over in spite of a
      faint resistance. Then they each went their own way, Selah to the little
      green-grocer&rsquo;s shop in a back street of the red-brick fisher
      village, and Herbert to his big fashionable hotel on the Marine Parade in
      the noisy stuccoed modern watering place.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s an awkward sort of muddle to have got oneself into.&rsquo; he
      thought to himself as he walked along the asphalte pavement in front of
      the sea-wall: &lsquo;a most confoundedly awkward fix to have got oneself
      into with a pretty girl of the lower classes. She&rsquo;s beautiful
      certainly; that there&rsquo;s no denying; the handsomest woman on the
      whole I ever remember to have seen at any time anywhere; and when I&rsquo;m
      actually by her side&mdash;though it&rsquo;s a weakness to confess it&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      really not quite sure that I&rsquo;m not positively quite in love with
      her! She&rsquo;d make a grand sort of Messalina, without a doubt, a model
      for a painter, with her frank imperious face, and her splendid voluptuous
      figure; a Faustina, a Catherine of Russia, an Ann Boleyn&mdash;to be fitly
      painted only by a Rubens or a Gustave Courbet. Yet how I can ever have
      been such a particular fool as to go and get myself entangled with her I
      can&rsquo;t imagine. Heredity, heredity; it must run in the family, for
      certain. There&rsquo;s Ernest has gone and handed himself over bodily to
      this grocer person somewhere down in Devonshire; and I myself, who
      perfectly see the folly of his absurd proceeding, have independently put
      myself into this very similar awkward fix with Selah Briggs here. Selah
      Briggs, indeed! The very name reeks with commingled dissent, vulgarity,
      and greengrocery. Her father&rsquo;s deacon of his chapel, and goes out at
      night when there&rsquo;s no missionary meeting on, to wait at serious
      dinner parties! Or rather, I suppose he&rsquo;d desert the most enticing
      missionary to earn a casual half-crown at even an ungodly
      champagne-drinking dinner! Then that&rsquo;s the difference between me and
      Ernest. Ernest&rsquo;s selfish, incurably and radically selfish. Because
      this Oswald girl happens to take his passing fancy, and to fit in with his
      impossible Schurzian notions, he&rsquo;ll actually go and marry her. Not
      only will he have no consideration for mother&mdash;who really is a very
      decent sort of body in her own fashion, if you don&rsquo;t rub her up the
      wrong way or expect too much from her&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll also
      interfere, without a thought, with MY prospects and my advancement. Now,
      THAT I call really selfish; and selfishness is a vulgar piggish vice that
      I thoroughly abominate. I don&rsquo;t deny that I&rsquo;m a trifle selfish
      myself, of course, in a refined and cultivated manner&mdash;I flatter
      myself, in fact, that introspective analysis is one of my strong points;
      and I don&rsquo;t conceal my own failings from my own consciousness with
      any weak girlish prevarications. But after all, as Hobbes very well showed
      (though our shallow modern philosophers pretend to laugh at him),
      selfishness in one form or another is at the very base of all human
      motives; the difference really is between sympathetic and unsympathetic
      selfishness&mdash;between piggishness and cultivated feelings. Now <i>I</i>
      will NOT give way to the foolish and selfish impulses which would lead me
      to marry Selah Briggs. I will put a curb upon my inclinations, and do what
      is really best in the end for all the persons concerned&mdash;and for
      myself especially.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He strolled down on to the beach, and began throwing pebbles carelessly
      into the plashing water. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he went on in his internal
      colloquy, &lsquo;I can only account for my incredible stupidity in this
      matter by supposing that it depends somehow upon some incomprehensible
      hereditary leaning in the Le Breton family idiosyncrasy. It&rsquo;s
      awfully unlike me, I will do myself the justice to say, to have got myself
      into such a silly dilemma all for nothing. It was all very well a few
      years ago, when I first met Selah. I was an undergraduate in those days,
      and even if somebody had caught me walking with a young lady of unknown
      antecedents and doubtful aspirates on the East Cliff at Hastings, it
      really wouldn&rsquo;t have much mattered. She was beautiful even then&mdash;though
      not so beautiful as now, for she grows handsomer every day; and it was
      natural enough I should have taken to going harmless walks about the place
      with her. She attracted me by her social rebelliousness&mdash;another
      family trait, in me passive not active, contemplative not personal; but
      she certainly attracted me. She attracts me still. A man must have some
      outlet for the natural and instinctive emotions of our common humanity;
      and if a monastic Oxford community imposes celibacy upon one with
      mediaeval absurdity&mdash;why, Selah Briggs is, for the time being, the
      only possible sort of outlet. One needn&rsquo;t marry her in the end; but
      for the moment it is certainly very excellent fooling. Not unsentimental
      either&mdash;for my part I could never care for mere coarse, commonplace,
      venal wretches. Indeed, when I spoke to her just now about my wishing to
      make my wife a lady, upon my word, at the time, I almost think I was just
      then quite in earnest. The idea flitted across my mind vaguely&mdash;&ldquo;Why
      not send her for a year or two to be polished up at Paris or somewhere,
      and really marry her afterwards for good and always?&rdquo; But on second
      thoughts, it won&rsquo;t hold water. She&rsquo;s magnificent, she&rsquo;s
      undeniable, she&rsquo;s admirable, but she isn&rsquo;t possible. The name
      alone&rsquo;s enough to condemn her. Fancy marrying somebody with a
      Christian name out of the hundred and somethingth psalm! It&rsquo;s too
      atrocious! I really couldn&rsquo;t inflict her for a moment on poor
      suffering innocent society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused awhile, watching the great russet sails of the fishing vessels
      flapping idly in the breeze as the men raised them to catch the faint
      breath of wind, and then he thought once more, &lsquo;But how to get rid
      of her, that&rsquo;s the question. Every time I come here now she goes on
      more and more about the necessity of our getting soon married&mdash;and I
      don&rsquo;t wonder at it either, for she has a perfect purgatory of a life
      with that snivelling Methodistical father of hers, one may be sure of it.
      It would be awfully awkward if any Oxford people were to catch me here
      walking with her on the cliff over yonder&mdash;some sniggering fellow of
      Jesus or Worcester, for example, or, worse than all, some prying young
      Pecksniff of a third-year undergraduate! Somehow, she seems to fascinate
      me, and I can&rsquo;t get away from her; but I must really do it and be
      done with it. It&rsquo;s no use going on this way much longer. I must stop
      here for a few days more only, and then tell her that I&rsquo;m called
      away on important college business, say to Yorkshire or Worcestershire, or
      somewhere. I needn&rsquo;t tell her in person, face to face: I can write
      hastily at the last moment to the usual name at the Post Office&mdash;to
      be left till called for. And as a matter of fact I won&rsquo;t go to
      Yorkshire either&mdash;very awkward and undignified, though, these petty
      prevarications; when a man once begins lowering himself by making love to
      a girl in an inferior position, he lets himself in for all kinds of
      disagreeable necessities afterwards;&mdash;I shall go to Switzerland. Yes,
      no place better after the bother of running away like a coward from Selah:
      in the Alps, one would forget all petty human degradations; I shall go to
      Switzerland. Of course I won&rsquo;t break off with her altogether&mdash;that
      would be cruel; and I really like her; upon my word, even when she isn&rsquo;t
      by, up to her own level, I really like her; but I&rsquo;ll let the thing
      die a natural death of inanition. As they always put it in the newspapers,
      with their stereotyped phraseology, a gradual coldness shall intervene
      between us. That&rsquo;ll be the best and only way out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And if I go to Switzerland, why not ask Oswald of Oriel to go with me?
      That, I fancy, wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad stroke of social policy. Ernest
      WILL marry this Oswald girl; unfortunately he&rsquo;s as headstrong as an
      allegory on the banks of the Nile; and as he&rsquo;s going to drag her
      inevitably into the family, I may as well put the best possible face upon
      the disagreeable matter. Let&rsquo;s make a virtue of necessity. The
      father and mother are old: they&rsquo;ll die soon, and be gathered to
      their fathers (if they had any), and the world will straightway forget all
      about them. But Oswald will always be there en évidence, and the safest
      thing to do will be to take him as much as possible into the world, and
      let the sister rest upon HIS reputation for her place in society. It&rsquo;s
      quite one thing to say that Ernest has married the daughter of a country
      grocer down in Devonshire, and quite another thing to say that he has
      married the sister of Oswald of Oriel, the distinguished mathematician and
      fellow of the Royal Society. How beautifully that warm brown sail stands
      out in a curve against the cold grey line of the horizon&mdash;a bulging
      curve just like the swell of Selah&rsquo;s neck, when she throws her head
      back, so, and lets you see the contour of her throat, her beautiful
      rounded throat&mdash;ah, that&rsquo;s not giving her up now, is it?&mdash;What
      a confounded fool I am, to be sure! Anybody would say, if they could only
      have read my thoughts that moment, that I was really in love with this
      girl Selah!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; YE MOUNTAINS OF GILBOA!
    </h2>
    <p>
      The old Englischer Hof at Pontresina looked decidedly sleepy and misty at
      five o&rsquo;clock on an August morning, when two sturdy British
      holiday-seekers, in knickerbockers and regular Alpine climbing rig, sat
      drinking their parting cup of coffee in the salle-à-manger, before
      starting to make the ascent of the Piz Margatsch, one of the tallest and
      by far the most difficult among the peaks of the Bernina range. There are
      few prettier villages in the Engadine than Pontresina, and few better
      hotels in all Switzerland than the old ivy-covered Englischer Hof. Yet on
      this particular morning, and at that particular hour, it certainly did
      look just a trifle cold and cheerless. &lsquo;He never makes very warm in
      the Engadine,&rsquo; Carlo the waiter observed with a shudder, in his best
      English, to one of the two early risers: &lsquo;and he makes colder on an
      August morning here than he makes at Nice in full December.&rsquo; For
      poor Carlo was one of those cosmopolitan waiters who follow the
      cosmopolitan tourist clientèle round all the spas, health resorts, kurs
      and winter quarters of fashionable Europe. In January he and his brother,
      as Charles and Henri, handed round absinthes and cigarettes at the Cercle
      Nautique at Nice; in April, as Carlo and Enrico, they turned up again with
      water ices and wafer cakes in the Caffè Manzoni at Milan; and in August,
      the observant traveller might recognise them once more under the disguise
      of Karl and Heinrich, laying the table d&rsquo;hôte in the long and narrow
      old-fashioned dining-room of the Englischer Hof at Pontresina. Though
      their native tongue was the patois of the Canton Ticino, they spoke all
      the civilised languages of the world, &lsquo;and also German,&rsquo; with
      perfect fluency, and without the slightest attempt at either grammar or
      idiomatic accuracy. And they both profoundly believed in their hearts that
      the rank, wealth, youth, beauty and fashion of all other nations were
      wisely ordained by the inscrutable designs of Providence for a single
      purpose, to enrich and reward the active, intelligent, and industrious
      natives of the Canton Ticino.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are the guides come yet?&rsquo; asked Harry Oswald of the waiter in
      somewhat feeble and hesitating German. He made it a point to speak German
      to the waiters, because he regarded it as the only proper and national
      language of the universal Teutonic Swiss people.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They await the gentlemans in the corridor,&rsquo; answered Carlo, in his
      own peculiar and racy English; for he on his side resented the imputation
      that any traveller need ever converse with him in any but that traveller&rsquo;s
      own tongue, provided only it was one of the recognised and civilised
      languages of the world, or even German. They are a barbarous and
      disgusting race, those Tedeschi, look you well, Signor; they address you
      as though you were the dust in the piazza; yet even from them a polite and
      attentive person may confidently look for a modest, a very modest, but
      still a welcome trink-geld.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then we&rsquo;d better hurry up, Oswald,&rsquo; said Herbert Le Breton,
      &lsquo;for guides are the most tyrannical set of people on the entire face
      of this planet. I shall have another cup of coffee before I go, though, if
      the guides swear at me roundly in the best Roumansch for it, anyhow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your acquaintance with the Roumansch dialect being probably limited,&rsquo;
      Harry Oswald answered, &lsquo;the difference between their swearing and
      their blessing would doubtless be reduced to a vanishing point. Though I&rsquo;ve
      noticed that swearing is really a form of human speech everywhere readily
      understanded of the people in spite of all differences of race or
      language. One touch of nature, you see; and swearing, after all, is
      extremely natural.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you ready?&rsquo; asked Herbert, having tossed off his coffee. ‘Yes?
      Then come along at once. I can feel the guides frowning at us through the
      partition.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned out into the street, with its green-shuttered windows all
      still closed in the pale grey of early morning, and walked along with the
      three guides by the high road which leads through rocks and fir-trees up
      to the beginning of the steep path to the Piz Margatsch. Passing the clear
      emerald-green waterfall that rushes from under the lower melting end of
      the Morteratsch glacier, they took at once to the narrow track by the
      moraine along the edge of the ice, and then to the glacier itself, which
      is easy enough climbing, as glaciers go, for a good pedestrian. Herbert Le
      Breton, the older mountaineer of the two, got over the big blocks readily
      enough; but Harry, less accustomed to Swiss expeditions, lagged and
      loitered behind a little, and required more assistance from the guides
      every now and again than his sturdy companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m getting rather blown at starting,&rsquo; Harry called out at
      last to Herbert, some yards in front of him. &lsquo;Do you think the
      despotic guide would let us sit down and rest a bit if we asked him very
      prettily?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Offer him a cigar first,&rsquo; Herbert shouted back, &lsquo;and then
      after a short and decent interval, prefer your request humbly in your
      politest French. The savage potentate always expects to be propitiated by
      gifts, as a preliminary to answering the petitions of his humble subjects.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I see,&rsquo; Harry said, laughing. &lsquo;Supply before grievances, not
      grievances before supply.&rsquo; And he halted a moment to light a cigar,
      and to offer one to each of the two guides who were helping him along on
      either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus mollified, the senior guide grudgingly allowed ten minutes&rsquo;
      halt and a drink of water at the bend by the corner of the glacier. They
      sat down upon the great translucent sea-green blocks and began talking
      with the taciturn chief guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is this glacier dangerous?&rsquo; Harry asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dangerous, monsieur? Oh no, not as one counts glaciers. It is very safe.
      There are seldom accidents.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But there have been some?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Some, naturally. You don&rsquo;t climb mountains always without
      accidents. There was one the first time anyone ever made the ascent of the
      Piz Margatsch. That was fifty years ago. My uncle was killed in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Killed in it?&rsquo; Harry echoed. &lsquo;How did it all happen, and
      where?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yonder, monsieur, in a crevasse that was then situated near the bend at
      the corner, just where the great crevasse you see before you now stands.
      That was fifty years ago; since then the glacier has moved much. Its
      substance, in effect, has changed entirely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tell us all about it,&rsquo; Herbert put in carelessly. He knew the guide
      wouldn&rsquo;t go on again till he had finished his whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s a strange tale,&rsquo; the guide answered, taking a puff or
      two at his cigar pensively and then removing it altogether for his set
      narrative&mdash;he had told the tale before a hundred times, and he had
      the very words of it now regularly by heart. &lsquo;It was the first time
      anyone ever tried to climb the Piz Margatsch. At that time, nobody in the
      valley knew the best path; it is my father who afterwards discovered it.
      Two English gentlemen came to Pontresina one morning; one might say you
      two gentlemen; but in those days there were not many tourists in the
      Engadine; the exploitation of the tourist had not yet begun to be
      developed. My father and my uncle were then the only two guides at
      Pontresina. The English gentlemen asked them to try with them the scaling
      of the Piz Margatsch. My uncle was afraid of it, but my father laughed
      down his fears. So they started. My uncle was dressed in a blue coat with
      brass buttons, and a pair of brown velvet breeches. Ah, heaven, I can see
      him yet, his white corpse in the blue coat and the brown velvet breeches!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But you can&rsquo;t be fifty yourself,&rsquo; Harry said, looking at the
      tall long-limbed man attentively; &lsquo;no, nor forty, nor thirty either.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, monsieur, I am twenty-seven,&rsquo; the chief guide answered, taking
      another puff at his cigar very deliberately; &lsquo;and this was fifty
      years ago: yet I have seen his corpse just as the accident happened. You
      shall hear all about it. It is a tale from the dead; it is worth hearing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This begins to grow mysterious,&rsquo; said Herbert in English, hammering
      impatiently at the ice with the shod end of his alpenstock. &lsquo;Sounds
      for all the world just like the introduction to a Christmas number.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A young girl in the village loved my uncle,&rsquo; the guide went on
      imperturbably; &lsquo;and she begged him not to go on this expedition. She
      was betrothed to him. But he wouldn&rsquo;t listen: and they all started
      together for the top of the Piz Margatsch. After many trials, my father
      and my uncle and the two tourists reached the summit. &ldquo;So you see,
      Andreas,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;your fears were all folly.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Half-way through the forest,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;one is
      not yet safe from the wolf.&rdquo; Then they began to descend again. They
      got down past all the dangerous places, and on to this glacier, so well
      known, so familiar. And then my uncle began indeed to get careless. He
      laughed at his own fears; &ldquo;Cathrein was all wrong,&rdquo; he said to
      my father, &ldquo;we shall get down again safely, with Our Lady&rsquo;s
      assistance.&rdquo; So they reached at last the great crevasse. My father
      and one of the Englishmen got over without difficulty; but the other
      Englishman slipped; his footing failed him; and he was sinking, sinking,
      down, down, down, slipping quickly into the deep dark green abyss below.
      My uncle stretched out his hand over the edge: the Englishman caught it;
      and then my uncle missed his foothold, they both fell together and were
      lost to sight at once completely, in the invisible depths of the great
      glacier!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,&rsquo; Herbert Le Breton said, as the man paused a moment. &lsquo;Is
      that all?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,&rsquo; the guide answered, with a tone of deep solemnity. &lsquo;That
      is not all. The glacier went on moving, moving, slowly, slowly, but always
      downward, for years and years. Yet no one ever heard anything more of the
      two lost bodies. At last one day, when I was seven years old, I went out
      playing with my brother, among the pine-woods, near the waterfall that
      rushes below there, from under the glacier. We saw something lying in the
      ice-cold water, just beneath the bottom of the ice-sheet. We climbed over
      the moraine; and there, oh heaven! we could see two dead bodies. They were
      drowned, just drowned, we thought: it might have been yesterday. One of
      them was short and thick-set, with the face of an Englishman: he was
      close-shaven, and, what seemed odd to us, he had on clothes which, though
      we were but children, we knew at once for the clothes of a long past
      fashion&mdash;in fact, a suit of the Louis dix-huit style. Tha other was a
      tall and handsome man, dressed in the unchangeable blue coat and brown
      velvet breeches of our own canton, of the Graubunden. We were very
      frightened about it, and so we ran away trembling and told an old woman
      who lived close by; her name was Cathrein, and her grandchildren used to
      play with us, though she herself was about the age of my father, for my
      father married very late. Old Cathrein came out with us to look; and the
      moment she saw the bodies, she cried out with a great cry, &ldquo;It is
      he! It is Andreas! It is my betrothed, who was lost on the very day week
      when I was to be married. I should know him at once among ten thousand. It
      is many, many years now, but I have not forgotten his face&mdash;ah, my
      God, that face; I know it well!&rdquo; And she took his hand in hers, that
      fair white young hand in her own old brown withered one, and kissed it
      gently. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is five years older
      than me, this fair young man here; five years older than me!&rdquo; We
      were frightened to hear her talk so, for we said to ourselves, &ldquo;She
      must be mad;&rdquo; so we ran home and brought our father. He looked at
      the dead bodies and at old Cathrein, and he said, &ldquo;It is indeed
      true. He is my brother.&rdquo; Ah, monsieur, you would not have forgotten
      it if you had seen those two old people standing there beside the fresh
      corpses they had not seen for all those winters! They themselves had
      meanwhile grown old and grey and wrinkled; but the ice of the glacier had
      kept those others young, and fresh, and fair, and beautiful as on the day
      they were first engulfed in it. It was terrible to look at!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A most ghastly story, indeed,&rsquo; Herbert Le Breton said, yawning;
      ‘and now I think we&rsquo;d better be getting under way again, hadn&rsquo;t
      we, Oswald?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Oswald rose from his seat on the block of ice unwillingly, and
      proceeded on his road up the mountain with a distinct and decided feeling
      of nervousness. Was it the guide&rsquo;s story that made his knees tremble
      slightly? was it his own inexperience in climbing? or was it the cold and
      the fatigue of the first ascent of the season to a man not yet in full
      pedestrian Alpine training? He did not feel at all sure about it in his
      own mind: but this much he knew with perfect certainty, that his footing
      was not nearly so secure under him as it had been during the earlier part
      of the climb over the lower end of the glacier.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by they reached the long sheer snowy slope near the Three Brothers.
      This slope is liable to slip, and requires careful walking, so the guides
      began roping them together. &lsquo;The stout monsieur in front, next after
      me,&rsquo; said the chief guide, knotting the rope soundly round Herbert
      Le Breton: &lsquo;then Kaspar; then you, monsieur,&rsquo; to Harry Oswald,
      &lsquo;and finally Paolo, to bring up the rear. The thin monsieur is
      nervous, I think; it&rsquo;s best to place him most in the middle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you really ARE nervous, Oswald,&rsquo; Herbert said, not unkindly,
      ‘you&rsquo;d better stop behind, I think, and let me go on with two of the
      guides. The really hard work, you know, has scarcely begun yet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh dear, no,&rsquo; Harry answered lightly (he didn&rsquo;t care to
      confess his timidity before Herbert Le Breton of all men in the world):
      &lsquo;I do feel just a little groggy about the knees, I admit; but it&rsquo;s
      not nervousness, it&rsquo;s only want of training. I haven&rsquo;t got
      accustomed to glacier-work yet, and the best way to overcome it is by
      constant practice. &ldquo;Solvitur ambulando,&rdquo; you know, as Aldrich
      says about Achilles and the tortoise.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very good,&rsquo; Herbert answered drily; &lsquo;only mind, whatever you
      do, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t go and stumble and pull ME down on
      the top of you. It&rsquo;s the clear duty of a good citizen to respect the
      lives of the other men who are roped together with him on the side of a
      mountain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They set to work again, in single file, with cautious steps planted firmly
      on the treacherous snow, to scale the great white slope that stretched so
      temptingly before them. Harry felt his knees becoming at every step more
      and more ungovernable, while Herbert didn&rsquo;t improve matters by
      calling out to him from time to time, &lsquo;Now, then, look out for a
      hard bit here,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mind that loose piece of ice there,&rsquo;
      or &lsquo;Be very careful how you put your foot down by the yielding edge
      yonder,&rsquo; and so forth. At last, they had almost reached the top of
      the slope, and were just above the bare gulley on the side, when Harry&rsquo;s
      insecure footing on a stray scrap of ice gave way suddenly, and he began
      to slip rapidly down the sheer slope of the mountain. In a second he had
      knocked against Paolo, and Paolo had begun to slip too, so that both were
      pulling with all their weight against Kaspar and the others in front.
      &lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, man,&rsquo; Herbert cried hastily, &lsquo;dig
      your alpenstock deep into the snow.&rsquo; At the same instant, the chief
      guide shouted in Roumansch to the same effect to Kaspar. But even as they
      spoke, Kaspar, pushing his feet hard against the snow, began to give way
      too; and the whole party seemed about to slip together down over the sheer
      rocky precipice of the great gulley on the right. It was a moment of
      supreme anxiety; but Herbert Le Breton, looking back with blood almost
      unstirred and calmly observant eye, saw at once the full scope of the
      threatening danger. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one chance,&rsquo; he said
      to himself quietly. &lsquo;Oswald is lost already! Unless the rope breaks,
      we are all lost together!&rsquo; At that very second, Harry Oswald,
      throwing his arms up wildly, had reached the edge of the terrible
      precipice; he went over with a piercing cry into the abyss, with the last
      guide beside him, and Kaspar following him close in mute terror. Then
      Herbert Le Breton felt the rope straining, straining, straining, upon the
      sharp frozen edge of the rock; for an inappreciable point of time it
      strained and crackled: one loud snap, and it was gone for ever. Herbert
      and the chief guide, almost upset by the sudden release from the heavy
      pull that was steadily dragging them over, threw themselves flat on their
      faces in the drifted snow, and checked their fall by a powerful muscular
      effort. The rope was broken and their lives were saved, but what had
      become of the three others?
    </p>
    <p>
      They crept cautiously on hands and knees to the most practicable spot at
      the edge of the precipice, and the guide peered over into the great white
      blank below with eager eyes of horrid premonition. As he did so, he
      recoiled with awe, and made a rapid gesture with his hands, half prayer,
      half speechless terror. &lsquo;What do you see?&rsquo; asked Herbert, not
      daring himself to look down upon the blank beneath him, lest he should be
      tempted to throw himself over in a giddy moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Jesu, Maria,&rsquo; cried the guide, crossing himself instinctively over
      and over again, &lsquo;they have all fallen to the very foot of the second
      precipice! They are lying, all three, huddled together on the ledge there
      just above the great glacier. They are dead, quite dead, dead before they
      reached the ground even. Great God, it is too terrible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Le Breton looked at the white-faced guide with just the faintest
      suspicion of a sneering curl upon his handsome features. The excitement of
      the danger was over now, and he had at once recovered his usual
      philosophic equanimity. &lsquo;Quite dead,&rsquo; he said, in French,
      &lsquo;quite dead, are they? Then we can&rsquo;t be of any further use to
      them. But I suppose we must go down again at once to help recover the dead
      bodies!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The guide gazed at him blankly with simple open-mouthed undisguised
      amazement. &lsquo;Naturally,&rsquo; he said, in a very quiet voice of
      utter disgust and loathing. &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t leave them lying
      there alone on the cold snow, would you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is really most annoying,&rsquo; thought Herbert Le Breton to
      himself, in his rational philosophic fashion: &lsquo;here we are, almost
      at the summit, and now we shall have to turn back again from the very
      threshold of our goal, without having seen the view for which we&rsquo;ve
      climbed up, and risked our lives too&mdash;all for a purely sentimental
      reason, because we won&rsquo;t leave those three dead men alone on the
      snow for an hour or two longer! it&rsquo;s a very short climb to the top
      now, and I could manage it by myself in twenty minutes. If only the chief
      guide had slid over with the others, I should have gone on alone, and had
      the view at least for my trouble. I could have pretended the accident
      happened on the way down again. As it is, I shall have to turn back
      ingloriously, re infecta. The guide will tell everybody at Pontresina that
      I went on, in spite of the accident; and then it would get into the
      English papers, and all the world would say that I was so dreadfully cruel
      and heartless. People are always so irrational in their ethical judgments.
      Oswald&rsquo;s quite dead, that&rsquo;s certain; nobody could fall over
      such a precipice as that without being killed a dozen times over before he
      even reached the bottom. A very painless and easy death too; I couldn&rsquo;t
      myself wish for a better one. We can&rsquo;t do them the slightest good by
      picking up their lifeless bodies, and yet a foolishly sentimental public
      opinion positively compels one to do it. Poor Oswald! Upon my soul I&rsquo;m
      sorry for him, and for that pretty little sister of his too; but what&rsquo;s
      the use of bothering about it? The thing&rsquo;s done, and nothing that I
      can do or say will ever make it any better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they turned once more in single file down by the great glacier, and
      retraced their way to Pontresina without exchanging another word. To say
      the truth, the chief guide felt appalled and frightened by the presence of
      this impassive, unemotional British traveller, and did not even care to
      conceal his feelings. But then he wasn&rsquo;t an educated philosopher and
      man of culture like Herbert Le Breton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that evening a party of twelve villagers brought back three stiff and
      mangled corpses on loose cattle hurdles into the village of Pontresina.
      Two of them were the bodies of two local Swiss guides, and the third, with
      its delicate face unscathed by the fall, and turned calmly upwards to the
      clear moonlight, was the body of Harry Oswald. Alas, alas, Gilboa! The
      beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; &lsquo;WHAT DO THESE HEBREWS HERE?&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      From Calcombe Pomeroy Ernest had returned, not to Dunbude, but to meet the
      Exmoor party in London. There he had managed somehow&mdash;he hardly knew
      how himself&mdash;to live through a whole season without an explosion in
      his employer&rsquo;s family. That an explosion must come, sooner or later,
      he felt pretty sure in his own mind for several reasons: his whole
      existence there was a mistake and an anomaly, and he could no more mix in
      the end with the Exmoor family than oil can mix with vinegar, or vice
      versâ. The round of dances and dinners to which he had to accompany his
      pupil was utterly distasteful to him. Lynmouth never learnt anything; so
      Ernest felt his own function in the household a perfectly useless one; and
      he was always on the eve of a declaration that he couldn&rsquo;t any
      longer put up with this, that, or the other &lsquo;gross immorality&rsquo;
      in which Lynmouth was actively or passively encouraged by his father and
      mother. Still, there were two things which indefinitely postponed the
      smouldering outbreak. In the first place, Ernest wrote to, and heard from,
      Edie every day; and he believed he ought for Edie&rsquo;s sake to give the
      situation a fair trial, as long as he was able, or at least till he saw
      some other opening, which might make it possible within some reasonable
      period to marry her. In the second place, Lady Hilda had perceived with
      her intuitive quickness the probability that a cause of dispute might
      arise between her father and Ernest, and had made up her mind as far as in
      her lay to prevent its ever coming to a head. She didn&rsquo;t wish Ernest
      to leave his post in the household&mdash;so much originality was hardly
      again to be secured in a hurry&mdash;and therefore she laid herself out
      with all her ingenuity to smooth over all the possible openings for a
      difference of opinion whenever they occurred. If Ernest&rsquo;s scruples
      were getting the upper hand of his calmer judgment, Lady Hilda read the
      change in his face at once, and managed dexterously to draw off Lynmouth,
      or to talk over her mother quietly to acquiesce in Ernest&rsquo;s view of
      the question. If Lord Exmoor was beginning to think that this young man&rsquo;s
      confounded fads were really getting quite unbearable, Lady Hilda
      interposed some casual remark about how much better Lynmouth was kept out
      of the way now than he used to be in Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s time. Ernest
      himself never even suspected this unobtrusive diplomatist and peacemaker;
      but as a matter of fact it was mainly owing to Lady Hilda&rsquo;s constant
      interposition that he contrived to stop in Wilton Place through all that
      dreary and penitential London season.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, to Ernest&rsquo;s intense joy, the season began to show
      premonitory symptoms of collapsing from inanition. The twelfth of August
      was drawing nigh, and the coming-of-age of grouse, that most important of
      annual events in the orthodox British social calendar, would soon set free
      Lord Exmoor and his brother hereditary legislators from their arduous duty
      of acting as constitutional drag on the general advance of a great,
      tolerant, and easy-going nation. Soon the family would be off again to
      Dunbude, or away to its other moors in Scotland; and among the rocks and
      the heather Ernest felt he could endure Lord Exmoor and Lord Lynmouth a
      little more resignedly than among the reiterated polite platitudes and
      monotonous gaieties of the vacuous London drawing-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda, too, was longing in her own way for the season to be over. She
      had gone through another of them, thank goodness, she said to herself at
      times with a rare tinge of pensiveness, only to discover that the Hughs,
      and the Guys, and the Algies, and the Montys were just as fatuously inane
      as ever; and were just as anxious as before to make her share their
      fatuous inanity for a whole lifetime. Only fancy living with an
      unadulterated Monty from the time you were twenty to the time you were
      seventy-five&mdash;at which latter date he, being doubtless some five
      years older than one-self to begin with, would probably drop off quietly
      with suppressed gout, and leave you a mourning widow to deplore his
      untimely and lamented extinction for the rest of your existence! Why, long
      before that time you would have got to know his very thoughts by heart (if
      he had any, poor fellow!) and would be able to finish all his sentences
      and eke out all his stories for him, the moment he began them. Much better
      marry a respectable pork-butcher outright, and have at least the healthful
      exercise of chopping sausage-meat to fill up the stray gaps in the
      conversation. In that condition of life, they say, people are at any rate
      perfectly safe from the terrors of ennui. However, the season was over at
      last, thank Heaven; and in a week or so more they would be at dear old
      ugly Dunbude again for the whole winter. There Hilda would go sketching
      once more on the moorland, and if this time she didn&rsquo;t make that
      stupid fellow Ernest see what she was driving at, why, then her name
      certainly wasn&rsquo;t Hilda Tregellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two before the legal period fixed for the beginning of the
      general grouse-slaughter, Ernest was sitting reading in the breakfast room
      at Wilton Place, when Lynmouth burst unexpectedly into the room in his
      usual boisterous fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, I say, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; he began, holding the door in his hand
      like one in a hurry, &lsquo;I want leave to miss work this morning. Gerald
      Talfourd has called for me in his dog-cart, and wants me to go out with
      him now immediately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not to-day, Lynmouth,&rsquo; Ernest answered quietly. &lsquo;You were out
      twice last week, you know, and you hardly ever get your full hours for
      work at all since we came to London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, but look here, you know, Mr. Le Breton; I really MUST go to-day,
      because Talfourd has made an appointment for me. It&rsquo;s awful fun&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      going to have some pigeon-shooting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest&rsquo;s countenance fell a little, and he answered in a graver
      voice than before, &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s what you want to go for,
      Lynmouth, I certainly can&rsquo;t let you go. You shall never have leave
      from me to go pigeon-shooting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why not?&rsquo; Lynmouth asked, still holding the door-handle at the most
      significant angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Because it&rsquo;s a cruel and brutal sport,&rsquo; Ernest replied,
      looking him in the face steadily; &lsquo;and as long as you&rsquo;re under
      my charge I can&rsquo;t allow you to take part in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, you can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Lynmouth mischievously, with a gentle
      touch of satire in his tone. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t you! Very
      well, then, never mind about it.&rsquo; And he shut the door after him
      with a bang, and ran off upstairs without further remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s time for study, Lynmouth,&rsquo; Ernest called out, opening
      the door and speaking to him as he retreated. &lsquo;Come down again at
      once, please, will you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lynmouth made no answer, and went straight off upstairs to the
      drawing-room. In a few minutes more he came back, and said in a tone of
      suppressed triumph, &lsquo;Well, Mr. Le Breton, I&rsquo;m going with
      Talfourd. I&rsquo;ve been up to papa, and he says I may &ldquo;if I like
      to.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest bit his lip in a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. If it had been any
      ordinary question, he would have pocketed the contradiction of his
      authority&mdash;after all, if it didn&rsquo;t matter to them, it didn&rsquo;t
      matter to him&mdash;and let Lynmouth go wherever they allowed him. But the
      pigeon-shooting was a question of principle. As long as the boy was still
      nominally his pupil, he couldn&rsquo;t allow him to take any part in any
      such wicked and brutal amusement, as he thought it. So he answered back
      quietly, &lsquo;No, Lynmouth, you are not to go. I don&rsquo;t think your
      father can have understood that I had forbidden you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh!&rsquo; Lynmouth said again, without a word of remonstrance, and went
      up a second time to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes a servant came down and spoke to Ernest. &lsquo;My lord
      would like to see you upstairs for a few minutes, if you please, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest followed the man up with a vague foreboding that the deferred
      explosion was at last about to take place. Lord Exmoor was sitting on the
      sofa. &lsquo;Oh, I say, Le Breton,&rsquo; he began in his good-humoured
      way, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s this that Lynmouth&rsquo;s been telling me about
      the pigeon-shooting? He says you won&rsquo;t let him go out with Gerald
      Talfourd.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,&rsquo; Ernest answered; &lsquo;he wanted to miss his morning&rsquo;s
      work, and I told him I couldn&rsquo;t allow him to do so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I said he might if he liked, Le Breton. Young Talfourd has called for
      him to go pigeon-shooting. And now Lynmouth tells me you refuse to let him
      go, after I&rsquo;ve given him leave. Is that so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Certainly,&rsquo; said Ernest. &lsquo;I said he couldn&rsquo;t go,
      because before he asked you I had refused him permission, and I supposed
      you didn&rsquo;t know he was asking you to reverse my decision.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, of course,&rsquo; Lord Exmoor answered, for he was not an
      unreasonable man after his lights. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, Le
      Breton, quite right, certainly. Discipline&rsquo;s discipline, we all
      know, and must be kept up under any circumstances. You should have told
      me, Lynmouth, that Mr. Le Breton had forbidden you to go. However, as
      young Talfourd has made the engagement, I suppose you don&rsquo;t mind
      letting him have a holiday now, at my request, Le Breton, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a dilemma indeed for Ernest. He hardly knew what to answer. He
      looked by chance at Lady Hilda, seated on the ottoman in the corner; and
      Lady Hilda, catching his eye, pursed up her lips visibly into the one
      word, &lsquo;Do.&rsquo; But Ernest was inexorable. If he could possibly
      prevent it, he would not let those innocent pigeons be mangled and
      slaughtered for a lazy boy&rsquo;s cruel gratification. That was the one
      clear duty before him; and whether he offended Lord Exmoor or not, he had
      no choice save to pursue it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, Lord Exmoor,&rsquo; he said resolutely, after a long pause. &lsquo;I
      should have no objection to giving him a holiday, but I can&rsquo;t allow
      him to go pigeon-shooting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why not?&rsquo; asked Lord Exmoor warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He says it&rsquo;s a cruel, brutal sport, papa,&rsquo; Lynmouth put in
      parenthetically, in spite of an angry glance from Hilda; &lsquo;and he won&rsquo;t
      let me go while I&rsquo;m his pupil.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s face grew very red indeed, and he rose from the sofa
      angrily. &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s it, Mr. Le Breton!&rsquo; he said, in a
      short sharp fashion. &lsquo;You think pigeon-shooting cruel and brutal, do
      you? Will you have the goodness to tell me, sir, do you know that I myself
      am in the habit of shooting pigeons at matches?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,&rsquo; Ernest answered, without flinching a muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes!&rsquo; cried Lord Exmoor, growing redder and redder. &lsquo;You knew
      that, Mr. Le Breton, and yet you told my son you considered the practice
      brutal and cruel! Is that the way you teach him to honour his parents? Who
      are you, sir, that you dare set yourself up as a judge of me and my
      conduct? How dare you speak to him of his father in that manner? How dare
      you stir him up to disobedience and insubordination against his elders?
      How dare you, sir; how dare you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest&rsquo;s face began to get red in return, and he answered with
      unwonted heat, &lsquo;How dare you address me so, yourself, Lord Exmoor?
      How dare you speak to me in that imperious manner? You&rsquo;re forgetting
      yourself, I think, and I had better leave you for the present, till you
      remember how to be more careful in your language. But Lynmouth is not to
      go pigeon-shooting. I object to his going, because the sport is a cruel
      and a brutal one, whoever may practise it. If I have any authority over
      him, I insist upon it that he shall not go. If he goes, I shall not stop
      here any longer. You can do as you like about it, of course, but you have
      my final word upon the matter. Lynmouth, go down to the study.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stop, Lynmouth,&rsquo; cried his father, boiling over visibly with
      indignation: &lsquo;Stop. Never mind what Mr. Le Breton says to you; do
      you hear me? Go out if you choose with Gerald Talfourd.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lynmouth didn&rsquo;t wait a moment for any further permission. He ran
      downstairs at once and banged the front door soundly after him with a
      resounding clatter. Lady Hilda looked imploringly at Ernest, and whispered
      half audibly, &lsquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it.&rsquo; Ernest stood a
      second irresolute, while the Earl tramped angrily up and down the
      drawing-room, and then he said in a calmer voice, &lsquo;When would it be
      convenient, Lord Exmoor, that I should leave you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Whenever you like,&rsquo; Lord Exmoor answered violently. &lsquo;To-day
      if you can manage to get your things together. This is intolerable,
      absolutely intolerable! Gross and palpable impertinence; in my own house,
      too! &ldquo;Cruel and brutal,&rdquo; indeed! &ldquo;Cruel and brutal.&rdquo;
      Fiddlesticks! Why, it&rsquo;s not a bit different from partridge-shooting!&rsquo;
      And he went out, closely followed by Ernest, leaving Lady Hilda alone and
      frightened in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest ran lightly upstairs to his own little study sitting-room. ‘I&rsquo;ve
      done it this time, certainly, as Lady Hilda said,&rsquo; he thought to
      himself; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t see how I could possibly have avoided
      it. Even now, when all&rsquo;s done, I haven&rsquo;t succeeded in saving
      the lives of the poor innocent tortured pigeons. They&rsquo;ll be mangled
      and hunted for their poor frightened lives, anyhow. Well, now I must look
      out for that imaginary schoolmastership, and see what I can do for dear
      Edie. I shan&rsquo;t be sorry to get out of this after all, for the place
      was an impossible one for me from the very beginning. I shall sit down
      this moment and write to Edie, and after that I shall take out my
      portmanteau and get the man to help me put my luggage up to go away this
      very evening. Another day in the house after this would be obviously
      impossible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there came a knock at the door&mdash;a timid, tentative
      sort of knock, and somebody put her head inquiringly halfway through the
      doorway. Ernest looked up in sudden surprise. It was Lady Hilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; she said, coming over towards the table where
      Ernest had just laid out his blotting-book and writing-paper: &lsquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t prevent myself from coming up to tell you how much I admire
      your conduct in standing up so against papa for what you thought was right
      and proper. I can&rsquo;t say how greatly I admire it. I&rsquo;m so glad
      you did as you did do. You have acted nobly.&rsquo; And Hilda looked
      straight into his eyes with the most speaking and most melting of glances.
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; she said to herself, &lsquo;according to all correct
      precedents, he ought to seize my hand fervently with a gentle pressure,
      and thank me with tears in his eyes for my kind sympathy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ernest, only looking puzzled and astonished, answered in the quietest
      of voices, &lsquo;Thank you very much, Lady Hilda: but I assure you there
      was really nothing at all noble, nothing at all to admire, in what I said
      or did in any way. In fact, I&rsquo;m rather afraid, now I come to think
      of it, that I lost my temper with your father dreadfully.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you won&rsquo;t go away?&rsquo; Hilda put in quickly. &lsquo;You
      think better of it now, do you? You&rsquo;ll apologise to papa, and go
      with us to Dunbude for the autumn? Do say you will, please, Mr. Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh dear, no,&rsquo; Ernest answered, smiling quietly at the bare idea of
      his apologising to Lord Exmoor. &lsquo;I certainly won&rsquo;t do that,
      whatever I do. To tell you the truth, Lady Hilda, I have not been very
      anxious to stop with Lynmouth all along: I&rsquo;ve found it a most
      unprofitable tutorship&mdash;no sense of any duty performed, or any work
      done for society: and I&rsquo;m not at all sorry that this accident should
      have broken up the engagement unexpectedly. At the same time, it&rsquo;s
      very kind of you to come up and speak to me about it, though I&rsquo;m
      really quite ashamed you should have thought there was anything
      particularly praiseworthy or commendable in my standing out against such
      an obviously cruel sport as pigeon-shooting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, but I do think so, whatever you may say, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; Hilda
      went on eagerly. &lsquo;I do think so, and I think it was very good of you
      to fight it out so against papa for what you believe is right and proper.
      For my own part, you know, I don&rsquo;t see any particular harm in
      pigeon-shooting. Of course it&rsquo;s very dreadful that the poor dear
      little things should be shot and wounded and winged and so forth; but then
      everything, almost, gets shot, you see&mdash;rabbits, and grouse, and
      partridges, and everything; so that really it&rsquo;s hardly worth while,
      it seems to me, making a fuss about it. Still, that&rsquo;s not the real
      question. You think it&rsquo;s wrong; which is very original and nice and
      proper of you; and as you think it&rsquo;s wrong, you won&rsquo;t
      countenance it in any way. I don&rsquo;t care, myself, whether it&rsquo;s
      wrong or not&mdash;I&rsquo;m not called upon, thank goodness, to decide
      the question; but I do care very much that you should suffer for what you
      think the right course of action.&rsquo; And Lady Hilda in her earnestness
      almost laid her hand upon his arm, and looked up to him in the most
      unmistakable and appealing fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re very good, I&rsquo;m sure, Lady Hilda,&rsquo; Ernest
      replied, half hesitatingly, wondering much in his own mind what on earth
      she could be driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, and then Hilda said pensively, &lsquo;And
      so we shall never walk together at Dunbude on the Clatter any more, Mr. Le
      Breton! We shall never climb again among the big boulders on those
      Devonshire hillsides! We shall never watch the red deer from the big pool
      on top of the sheep-walk! I&rsquo;m sorry for it, Mr. Le Breton, very
      sorry for it. Oh, I do wish you weren&rsquo;t going to leave us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest began to feel that this was really growing embarrassing. &lsquo;I
      dare say we shall often see one another,&rsquo; he said evasively; for
      simple-minded as he was, a vague suspicion of what Lady Hilda wanted him
      to say had somehow forced itself timidly upon him. &lsquo;London&rsquo;s a
      very big place, no doubt; but still, people are always running together
      unexpectedly in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda sighed and looked at him again intently without speaking. She stood
      so, face to face with him across the table for fully two minutes; and
      then, seeming suddenly to awake from a reverie, she started and sighed
      once more, and turned at last reluctantly to leave the little study.
      &lsquo;I must go,&rsquo; she said hastily; &lsquo;mamma would be very
      angry indeed with me if she knew I&rsquo;d come here; but I couldn&rsquo;t
      let you leave the house without coming up to tell you how greatly I admire
      your spirit, and how very, very much I shall always miss you, Mr. Le
      Breton. Will you take this, and keep it as a memento?&rsquo; As she spoke,
      she laid an envelope upon the table, and glided quietly out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest took the envelope up with a smile, and opened it with some
      curiosity. It contained a photograph, with a brief inscription on the
      back, &lsquo;E. L. B., from Hilda Tregellis.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so, Hilda Tregellis, red and pale by turns, had rushed into her
      own room, locked the door wildly, and flung herself in a perfect tempest
      of tears on her own bed, where she lay and tossed about in a burning agony
      of shame and self-pity for twenty minutes. ‘He doesn&rsquo;t love me,&rsquo;
      she said to herself bitterly; &lsquo;he doesn&rsquo;t love me, and he
      doesn&rsquo;t care to love me, or want to marry me either! I&rsquo;m sure
      he understood what I meant, this time; and there was no response in his
      eyes, no answer, no sympathy. He&rsquo;s like a block of wood&mdash;a
      cold, impassive, immovable, lifeless creature! And yet I could love him&mdash;oh,
      if only he would say a word to me in answer, how I could love him! I loved
      him when he stood up there and bearded papa in his own drawing-room, and
      asked him how dare he speak so, how dare he address him in such a manner;
      I KNEW then that I really loved him. If only he would let me! But he won&rsquo;t!
      To think that I could have half the Algies and Berties in London at my
      feet for the faintest encouragement, and I can&rsquo;t have this one poor
      penniless Ernest Le Breton, though I go down on my knees before him and
      absolutely ask him to marry me! That&rsquo;s the worst of it! I&rsquo;ve
      humiliated myself before him by letting him see, oh, ever so much too
      plainly, that I wanted him to ask me; and I&rsquo;ve been repulsed,
      rejected, positively refused and slighted by him! And yet I love him! I
      shall never love any other man as I love Ernest Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lady Hilda Tregellis! Even she too had, at times, her sentimental
      moments! And there she lay till her eyes were red and swollen with crying,
      and till it was quite hopeless to expect she could ever manage to make
      herself presentable for the Cecil Faunthorpes&rsquo; garden-party that
      afternoon at Twickenham.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; EVIL TIDINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ernest had packed his portmanteau, and ordered a hansom, meaning to take
      temporary refuge at Number 28 Epsilon Terrace; and he went down again for
      a few minutes to wait in the breakfast-room, where he saw the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;
      lying casually on the little table by the front window. He took it up,
      half dreamily, by way of having something to do, and was skimming the
      telegrams in an unconcerned manner, when his attention was suddenly
      arrested by the name Le Breton, printed in conspicuous type near the
      bottom of the third column. He looked closer at the paragraph, and saw
      that it was headed &lsquo;Accident to British Tourists in Switzerland.&rsquo;
      A strange tremor seized him immediately. Could anything have happened,
      then, to Herbert? He read the telegram through at once, and found this
      bald and concise summary before him of the fatal Pontresina accident:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As Mr. H. Oswald, F.R.S., of Oriel College, Oxford, and Mr. Le Breton,
      Fellow and Bursar of St. Aldate&rsquo;s College, along with three guides,
      were making the ascent of the Piz Margatsch, in the Bernina Alps, this
      morning, one of the party happened to slip near the great gulley known as
      the Gouffre. Mr. Oswald and two of the guides were precipitated over the
      edge of the cliff and killed immediately: the breaking of the rope at a
      critical moment alone saved the lives of Mr. Le Breton and the remaining
      guide. The bodies have been recovered this evening, and brought back to
      Pontresina.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest laid down the paper with a thrill of horror. Poor Edie! How
      absolutely his own small difficulties with Lord Exmoor faded out of has
      memory at once in the face of that terrible, irretrievable calamity. Harry
      dead! The hope and mainstay of the family&mdash;the one great pride and
      glory of all the Oswalds, on whom their whole lives and affections
      centred, taken from them unexpectedly, without a chance of respite,
      without a moment&rsquo;s warning! Worst of all, they would probably learn
      it, as he did, for the first time by reading it accidentally in the curt
      language of the daily papers. Pray heaven the shock might not kill poor
      Edie!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only a minute in which to make up his mind, but in that minute
      Ernest had fully decided what he ought to do, and how to do it. He must go
      at once down to Calcombe Pomeroy, and try to lighten this great affliction
      for poor little Edie. Nay, lighten it he could not, but at least he could
      sympathise with her in it, and that, though little, was still some faint
      shade better than nothing at all. How fortunate that his difference with
      the Exmoors allowed him to go that very evening without a moment&rsquo;s
      delay. When the hansom arrived at the door, Ernest told the cabman to
      drive at once to Paddington Station. Almost before he had had time to
      realise the full meaning of the situation, he had taken a third-class
      ticket for Calcombe Road, and was rushing out of London by the Plymouth
      express, in one of the convenient and commodious little wooden horse-boxes
      which the Great Western Railway Company provide as a wholesome deterrent
      for economical people minded to save half their fare by going third
      instead of first or second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Didcot, Swindon, Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Newton Abbot, all followed one
      after another, and by the time Ernest had reached Calcombe Road Station he
      had begun to frame for himself a definite plan of future action. He would
      stop at the Red Lion Inn that evening, send a telegram from Exeter
      beforehand to Edie, to say he was coming next day, and find out as much as
      possible about the way the family had borne the shock before he ventured
      actually to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Calcombe omnibus, drawn by two lean and weary horses, toiled its way
      slowly up the long steep incline for six miles to the Cross Foxes, and
      then rattled down the opposite slope, steaming and groaning, till it drew
      up at last with a sudden jerk and a general collapse in front of the old
      Red Lion Inn in the middle of the High Street. There Ernest put up for the
      present, having seen by the shutters at the grocer&rsquo;s shop on his way
      down that the Oswalds had already heard of Harry&rsquo;s accident. He had
      dinner by himself, with a sick heart, in the gloomy, close little
      coffee-room of the village inn, and after dinner he managed to draw in the
      landlord in person for a glass of sherry and half an hour&rsquo;s
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very sad thing, sir, this &lsquo;ere causality in Switzerland,&rsquo;
      said the red-faced landlord, coming round at once to the topic of the day
      at Calcombe, after a few unimportant preliminary generalities. ‘Young Mr.
      Oswald, as has been killed, he lived here, sir; leastways his parents do.
      He was a very promising young gentleman up at Oxford, they do tell me&mdash;not
      much of a judge of horses, I should say, but still, I understand, quite
      the gentleman for all that. Very sad thing, the causality, sir, for all
      his family. &lsquo;Pears he was climbing up some of these &lsquo;ere Alps
      they have over there in them parts, covered with snow from head to foot in
      the manner of speaking, and there was another gentleman from Oxford with
      him, a Mr. Le Breton&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My brother,&rsquo; Ernest put in, interrupting him; for he thought it
      best to let the landlord know at once who he was talking to.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, your brother, sir!&rsquo; said the red-faced landlord, with a gleam
      of recognition, growing redder and hotter than ever; &lsquo;well, now you
      mention it, sir, I find I remember your face somehow. No offence, sir, but
      you&rsquo;re the young gentleman as come down in the spring to see young
      Mr. Oswald, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, well, sir,&rsquo; the landlord went on more freely&mdash;for of
      course all Calcombe had heard long since that Ernest was engaged to Edie
      Oswald&mdash;&lsquo;you&rsquo;re one of the family like, in that case, if
      I may make bold to say so. Well, sir, this is a shocking trouble for poor
      old Mr. Oswald, and no mistake. The old gentleman was sort of centred on
      his son, you see, as the saying is: never thought of nobody else hardly,
      he didn&rsquo;t. Old Mr. Oswald, sir, was always a wonderful hand at
      figgers hisself, and powerful fond of measurements and such kinds of
      things. I&rsquo;ve heard tell, indeed, as how he knew more mathematics,
      and trigononomy, and that, than the rector and the schoolmaster both put
      together. There&rsquo;s not one in fifty as knows as much mathematics as
      he do, I&rsquo;ll warrant. Well, you see, he brought up this son of his,
      little Harry as was&mdash;I can remember him now, running to and from the
      school, and figgerin&rsquo; away on the slates, doin&rsquo; the sums in
      algemer for the other boys when they went a-mitchin&rsquo;&mdash;he
      brought him up like a gentleman, as you know very well, sir, and sent him
      to Oxford College: &ldquo;to develop his mathematical talents, Mr. Legge,&rdquo;
      his father says to me here in this very parlour. What&rsquo;s the
      consequence? He develops that boy&rsquo;s talent sure enough, sir, till he
      comes to be a Fellow of Oxford College, they tell me, and even admitted
      into the Royal Society up in London. But this is how he did it, sir: and
      as you&rsquo;re a friend of the family like, and want to know all about
      it, no doubt, I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; you on the strict
      confidential, in the manner of speakin&rsquo;.&rsquo; Here the landlord
      drew his chair closer, and sipped the last drop in his glass of sherry
      with a mysterious air of very private and important disclosures. Ernest
      listened to his roundabout story with painful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, sir,&rsquo; the landlord went on after a short and pensive pause,
      ‘old Mr. Oswald&rsquo;s business ain&rsquo;t never been a prosperous one&mdash;though
      he was such a clover hand at figgers, he never made it remunerative; a
      bare livin&rsquo; for the family, I don&rsquo;t mind sayin&rsquo;; and he
      always spent more&rsquo;n he ought to &lsquo;a done on Mr. Harry, and on
      the young lady too, sir, savin&rsquo; your presence. So when Mr. Harry was
      goin&rsquo; to Oxford to college, he come to me, and he says to me,
      &ldquo;Mr. Legge,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a very expensive thing
      sending my boy to the University,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
      going to borrow money to send him with.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go
      a-doin&rsquo; that, Mr. Oswald,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;your business don&rsquo;t
      justify you in doin&rsquo; it, sir,&rdquo; says I. For you see, I knowed
      all the ins and outs of that there business, and I knowed he hadn&rsquo;t
      never made more&rsquo;n enough just to keep things goin&rsquo; decent
      like, as you may say, without any money saved or put by against a
      emergence. &ldquo;Yes, I will, Mr. Legge,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;I can
      trust confidentially in my son&rsquo;s abilities,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and
      I feel confidential he&rsquo;ll be in a position to repay me before long.&rdquo;
      So he borrowed the money on an insurance of Mr. Harry&rsquo;s life. Mr.
      Harry he always acted very honourable, sir; he was a perfect gentleman in
      every way, as YOU know, sir; and he began repayin&rsquo; his father the
      loan as fast as he was able, and I daresay doin&rsquo; a great deal for
      the family, and especially for the young lady, sir, out of his own pocket
      besides. But he still owed his father a couple of hundred pound an&rsquo;
      more when this causality happened, while the business, I know, had been
      a-goin&rsquo; to rack and ruin for the last three year. To-day I seen the
      agent of the insurance, and he says to me, &ldquo;Legge,&rdquo; says he,
      most private like, &ldquo;this is a bad job about young Oswald, I&rsquo;m
      afeard, worse&rsquo;n they know for.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sir?&rdquo; says
      I. &ldquo;Well, Legge,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll never get a
      penny of that there insurance, and the old gentleman&rsquo;ll have to pay
      up the defissit on his own account,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
      that, Mr. Micklethwaite?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a clause in the policy agin exceptional risks, in
      which is included naval and military services, furrin residences, topical
      voyages, and mountain-climbin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and you mark
      my words,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll never get a penny of it.&rdquo;
      In which case, sir, it&rsquo;s my opinion that old Mr. Oswald&rsquo;ll be
      clean broke, for he can&rsquo;t never make up the defissit out of his own
      business, can he now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest listened with sad forebodings to the red-faced landlord&rsquo;s
      pitiful story, and feared in his heart that it was a bad look-out for the
      poor Oswalds. He didn&rsquo;t sleep much that evening, and next day he
      went round early to see Edie. The telegram he found would be a useless
      precaution, for the gossip of Calcombe Pomeroy had recognised him at once,
      and news had reached the Oswalds almost as soon as he arrived that young
      Mr. Le Breton was stopping that evening at the Red Lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie opened the door for him herself, pale of face and with eyes reddened
      by tears, yet looking beautiful even so in her simple black morning dress,
      her mourning of course hadn&rsquo;t yet come home&mdash;and her deep white
      linen collar. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you to have come so soon, Mr.
      Le Breton,&rsquo; she said, taking his hand quietly&mdash;he respected her
      sorrow too deeply to think of kissing her; &lsquo;he will be back with us
      to-morrow. Your brother is bringing him back to us, to lay him in our
      little churchyard, and we are all so very very grateful to him for it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest was more than half surprised to hear it. It was an unusual act of
      kindly thoughtfulness on the part of Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the body came home as Edie had said, and Ernest helped to lay it
      reverently to rest in Calcombe churchyard. Poor old Mr. Oswald, standing
      bowed and broken-hearted by the open grave side, looked as though he could
      never outlive that solemn burial of all his hopes and aspirations in a
      single narrow coffin. Yet it was wonderful to Ernest to see how much
      comfort he took, even in this terrible grief, from the leader which
      appeared in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; that morning on the subject of the
      Pontresina accident. It contained only a few of the stock newspaper
      platitudes of regret at the loss of a distinguished and rising young light
      of science&mdash;the ordinary glib commonplaces of obituary notices which
      a practised journalist knows so well how to adapt almost mechanically to
      the passing event of the moment; but they seemed to afford the shattered
      old country grocer an amount of consolation and solemn relief that no mere
      spoken condolences could ever possibly have carried with them. &lsquo;See
      what a wonderful lot they thought of our boy up in London, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo;
      he said, looking up from the paper tearfully, and wiping his big gold
      spectacles, dim with moisture. &lsquo;See what the &ldquo;Times&rdquo;
      says about him: &ldquo;One of the ablest among our young academical
      mathematicians, a man who, if his life had been spared to us, might
      probably have attained the highest distinction in his own department of
      pure science.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s our Harry, Mr. Le Breton; that&rsquo;s
      what the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; says about our dear, dead Harry! I wish he
      could have lived to read it himself, Edie&mdash;&ldquo;a scholar of
      singularly profound attainments, whose abilities had recently secured him
      a place upon the historic roll of the Royal Society, and whom even the
      French Academy of Sciences had held worthy out of all the competitors of
      the civilised world, to be adjudged the highest mathematical honours of
      the present season.&rdquo; My poor boy! my poor, dear, lost boy! I wish
      you could have lived to hear it! We must keep the paper, Edie: we must
      keep all the papers; they&rsquo;ll show us at least what people who are
      real judges of these things thought about our dear, loved, lost Harry.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest dared hardly glance towards poor Edie, with the tears trickling
      slowly down her face; but he felt thankful that the broken-hearted old
      father could derive so much incomprehensible consolation from those cold
      and stereotyped conventional phrases. Truly a wonderful power there is in
      mere printer&rsquo;s ink properly daubed on plain absorbent white paper.
      And truly the human heart, full to bursting and just ready to break will
      allow itself to be cheated and cajoled in marvellous fashions by
      extraordinary cordials and inexplicable little social palliatives. The
      concentrated hopes of that old man&rsquo;s life were blasted and blighted
      for ever; and he found a temporary relief from that stunning shock in the
      artificial and insincere condolences of a stock leader-writer on a daily
      paper!
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking back by himself in such sad meditations to the Red Lion, and
      sitting there by the open window, Ernest overheard a tremulous chattering
      voice mumbling out a few incoherent words at the Rector&rsquo;s doorway
      opposite. &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; chirped out the voice in a tone of
      cheerful resignation, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very sad indeed, very sad and
      shocking, and I&rsquo;m naturally very sorry for it, of course. I always
      knew how it would be: I warned them of it; but they&rsquo;re a pig-headed,
      heedless, unmannerly family, and they wouldn&rsquo;t be guided by me. I
      said to him, &ldquo;Now, Oswald, this is all very wrong and foolish of
      you. You go and put your son to Oxford, when he ought to be stopping at
      home, minding the shop and learning your business. You borrow money
      foolishly to send him there with. He&rsquo;ll go to Oxford; he&rsquo;ll
      fall in with a lot of wealthy young gentlemen&mdash;people above his own
      natural station&mdash;he&rsquo;ll take up expensive, extravagant ways, and
      in the end he&rsquo;ll completely ruin himself. He won&rsquo;t pay you
      back a penny, you may depend upon it&mdash;these boys never do, when you
      make fine gentlemen of them; they think only of their cigars and their
      horses, and their dog-carts and so forth, and neglect their poor old
      fathers and mothers, that brought them up and scraped and saved to make
      fine gentlemen of them. You just take my advice, Oswald, and don&rsquo;t
      send him to college.&rdquo; But Oswald was always a presumptuous,
      high-headed, independent sort of man, and instead of listening to me, what
      does he do but go and send this sharp boy of his up to Oxford. Well, now
      the boy&rsquo;s gone to Switzerland with one of the young Le Bretons&mdash;brother
      of the poor young man they&rsquo;ve inveigled into what they call an
      engagement with Miss Edith, or Miss Jemima, or whatever the girl&rsquo;s
      name is&mdash;very well-connected people, the Le Bretons, and personal
      friends of the Archdeacon&rsquo;s&mdash;and there he&rsquo;s thrown
      himself over a precipice or something of the sort, no doubt to avoid his
      money-matters and debts and difficulties. At any rate, Micklethwaite tells
      me the poor old father&rsquo;ll have to pay up a couple of hundred pound
      to the insurance company: and how on earth he&rsquo;s ever to do it <i>I</i>
      don&rsquo;t know, for to my certain knowledge the rent of the shop is in
      arrears half-a-year already. But it&rsquo;s no business of mine, thank
      goodness!&mdash;and I only hope that exposure will serve to open that poor
      young Le Breton&rsquo;s eyes, and to warn him against having anything
      further to say to Miss Jemima. A designing young minx, if ever there was
      one! Poor young Le Breton&rsquo;s come down here for the funeral, I hear,
      which I must say was very friendly and proper and honourable of him; but
      now it&rsquo;s over, I hope he&rsquo;ll go back again, and see Miss Jemima
      in her true colours.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest turned back into the stuffy little coffee-room with his face on
      fire and his ears tingling with mingled shame and indignation. ‘Whatever
      happens,&rsquo; he thought to himself, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t permit Edie to
      be subjected any longer to such insolence as this! Poor, dear, guileless,
      sorrowing little maiden! One would have thought her childish innocence and
      her terrible loss would have softened the heart even of such a
      cantankerous, virulent old harridan as that, till a few weeks were over,
      at least. She spoke of the Archdeacon: it must be old Miss Luttrell!
      Whoever it is, though, Edie shan&rsquo;t much longer be left where she can
      possibly come in contact with such a loathsome mass of incredible and
      unprovoked malice. That Edie should lose her dearly-loved brother is
      terrible enough; but that she should be exposed afterwards to be triumphed
      over in her most sacred grief by that bad old woman&rsquo;s querulous
      &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; is simply intolerable!&rsquo; And he paced up
      and down the room with a boiling heart, unable to keep down his righteous
      anger.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; FLAT REBELLION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the next fortnight Ernest remained at the Red Lion, though painfully
      conscious that he was sadly wasting his little reserve of funds from his
      late tutorship, in order to find out exactly what the Oswalds&rsquo;
      position would be after the loss of poor Harry. Towards the end of that
      time he took Edie, pale and pretty in her simple new mourning, out once
      more into the Bourne Close for half an hour&rsquo;s quiet conversation.
      Very delicate and sweet and refined that tiny girlish face and figure
      looked in the plain unostentatious black and white of her great sorrow,
      and Ernest felt as he walked along by her side that she seemed to lean
      upon him naturally now; the loss of her main support and chief advisor in
      life seemed to draw her closer and closer every day to her one remaining
      prop and future husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Edie,&rsquo; he said to her, as they rested once more beside the old
      wooden bridge across the little river, &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s time now
      we should begin to talk definitely over our common plans for the future. I
      know you&rsquo;d naturally rather wait a little longer before discussing
      them; I wish for both our sakes we could have deferred it; but time
      presses, and I&rsquo;m afraid from what I hear in the village that things
      won&rsquo;t go on henceforth exactly as they used to do with your dear
      father and mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie coloured slightly as she answered, &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve heard of
      all that already, Ernest&rsquo;&mdash;she was learning to call him &lsquo;Ernest&rsquo;
      now quite naturally. &lsquo;The Calcombe tattle has got round to you so
      soon! I&rsquo;m glad of it, though, for it saves me the pain of having to
      tell you. Yes, it&rsquo;s quite true, and I&rsquo;m afraid it will be a
      terrible, dreadful struggle for poor darling father and mother.&rsquo; And
      the tears came up afresh, as she spoke, into her big black eyes&mdash;too
      familiar with them of late to make her even try to brush them away hastily
      from Ernest&rsquo;s sight with her little handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m sorry to know it&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; Ernest said, taking her
      hand gently; ‘very, very sorry. We must do what we can to lighten the
      trouble for them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,&rsquo; Edie replied, looking at him through her tears; &lsquo;I mean
      to try. At any rate, I won&rsquo;t be a burden to them myself any longer.
      I&rsquo;ve written already up to an agency in London to see whether they
      can manage to get me a place as a nursery-governess.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You a governess, Edie!&rsquo; Ernest exclaimed hastily, with a gesture of
      deprecation. &lsquo;You a governess! Why, my own precious darling, you
      would never do for it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh yes, indeed,&rsquo; Edie answered quickly, &lsquo;I really think I
      could, Ernest. Of course I don&rsquo;t know very much&mdash;not judged by
      a standard like yours or our dear Harry&rsquo;s. Harry used to say all a
      woman could ever know was to find out how ignorant she was. Dear fellow!
      he was so very learned himself he couldn&rsquo;t understand the
      complacency of little perky, half-educated schoolmistresses. But still, I
      know quite as much, I think, in my little way, as a great many girls who
      get good places in London as governesses. I can speak French fairly well,
      you know, and read German decently; and then dear Harry took such a lot of
      pains to make me get up books that he thought were good for me&mdash;history
      and so forth&mdash;and even to teach me a little, a very little, Latin. Of
      course I know I&rsquo;m dreadfully ignorant; but not more so, I really
      believe, than a great many girls whom people consider quite well-educated
      enough to teach their daughters. After all, the daughters themselves are
      only women, too, you see, Ernest, and don&rsquo;t expect more than a
      smattering of book-knowledge, and a few showy fashionable accomplishments.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Edie,&rsquo; Ernest answered, smiling at her gently in spite of
      her tearful earnestness; &lsquo;you quite misunderstand me. It wasn&rsquo;t
      THAT I was thinking of at all. There are very few governesses and very few
      women anywhere who have half the knowledge and accomplishments and
      literary taste and artistic culture that you have; very few who have had
      the advantage of associating daily with such a man as poor Harry; and if
      you really wanted to get a place of the sort, the mere fact that you&rsquo;re
      Harry&rsquo;s sister, and that he interested himself in superintending
      your education, ought, by itself, to ensure your getting a very good one.
      But what I meant was rather this&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t endure to think
      that you should be put to all the petty slights and small humiliations
      that a governess has always to endure in rich families. You don&rsquo;t
      know what it is, Edie; you can&rsquo;t imagine the endless devices for
      making her feel her dependence and her artificial inferiority that these
      great people have devised in their cleverness and their Christian
      condescension. You don&rsquo;t know what it is, Edie, and I pray heaven
      you may never know; but <i>I</i> do, for I&rsquo;ve seen it&mdash;and,
      darling, I CAN&rsquo;T let you expose yourself to it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To say the truth, at that moment there rose very vividly before Ernest&rsquo;s
      eyes the picture of poor shy Miss Merivale, the governess at Dunbude to
      little Lady Sybil, Lynmouth&rsquo;s younger sister. Miss Merivale was a
      rector&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;an orphan, and a very nice girl in her way;
      and Ernest had often thought to himself while he lived at the Exmoors&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;With just the slightest turn of Fortune&rsquo;s wheel that might be
      my own Edie.&rsquo; Now, for himself he had never felt any sense of social
      inferiority at all at Dunbude; he was an Oxford man, and by the ordinary
      courtesy of English society he was always treated accordingly in every way
      as an equal. But there were galling distinctions made in Miss Merivale&rsquo;s
      case which he could not think of even at the time without a blush of
      ingenuous shame, and which he did not like now even to mention to pretty,
      shrinking, eager little Edie. One thing alone was enough to make his
      cheeks burn whenever he thought of it&mdash;a little thing, and yet how
      unendurable! Miss Merivale lunched with the family and with her pupil in
      the middle of the day, but she did not dine with them in the evening. She
      had tea by herself instead in Lady Sybil&rsquo;s little school-room. Many
      a time when Ernest had been out walking with her on the terrace just
      before dinner, and the dressing-gong sounded, he had felt almost too
      ashamed to go in at the summons and leave the poor little governess out
      there alone with her social disabilities. The gong seemed to raise such a
      hideous artificial barrier between himself and that delicately-bred,
      sensitive, cultivated English lady. That Edie should be subjected to such
      a life of affronts as that was simply unendurable. True, there are social
      distinctions of the sort which even Ernest Le Breton, communist as he was,
      could not practically get over; but then they were distinctions
      familiarised to the sufferers from childhood upward, and so perhaps a
      little less insupportable. But that Harry Oswald&rsquo;s sister&mdash;that
      Edie, his own precious delicate little Edie, a dainty English wild-flower
      of the tenderest, should be transplanted from her own appreciative home to
      such a chilly and ungenial soil as that&mdash;the very idea of it was
      horribly unspeakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, Ernest,&rsquo; Edie answered, breaking in upon his bitter
      meditation, ‘I assure you I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it a bit. I know&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      very dreadful, but then,&rsquo;&mdash;and here she blushed one of her
      pretty apologetic little blushes&mdash;&lsquo;you know I&rsquo;m used to
      it. People in business always are. They expect to be treated just like
      servant&mdash;now THAT, I know you&rsquo;ll say, is itself a piece of
      hubris, the expression of a horrid class prejudice. And so it is, no
      doubt. But they do, for all that. As dear Harry used to say, even the
      polypes in aristocratic useless sponges at the sea-bottom won&rsquo;t have
      anything to say to the sponges of commerce. I&rsquo;m sure nobody I could
      meet in a governess&rsquo;s place could possibly be worse in that respect
      than poor old Miss Catherine Luttrell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That may be true, Edie darling,&rsquo; Ernest answered, not caring to let
      her know that he had overheard a specimen of the Calcombe squirearchy,
      &lsquo;but in any case I don&rsquo;t want you to be troubled now, either
      with old Miss Luttrell or any other bitter old busybodies. I want to speak
      seriously to you about a very different project. Just look at this
      advertisement.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a scrap of paper from his pocket and handed it to Edie. It ran
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;WANTED at Pilbury Regis Grammar School, Dorset, a
    Third Classical Master. Must be a Graduate of Oxford or
    Cambridge; University Prizeman preferred. If unmarried,
    to take house duty. Commence September 20th. Salary,
    200L a year. Apply, as above, to the Rev. J. Greatrex,
    D.D., Head Master.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      Edie read it through slowly. &lsquo;Well, Ernest?&rsquo; she said, looking
      up from it into his face. &lsquo;Do you think of taking this mastership?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I can get it,&rsquo; Ernest answered. &lsquo;You see, I&rsquo;m not a
      University Prizeman, and that may be a difficulty in the way; but
      otherwise I&rsquo;m not unlikely to suit the requirements. Herbert knows
      something of the school&mdash;he&rsquo;s been down there to examine; and
      Mrs. Greatrex had a sort of distant bowing acquaintance with my mother; so
      I hope their influence might help me into it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Ernest?&rsquo; Edie cried again, feeling pretty certain in her own
      heart what was coming next, and reddening accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Edie, in that case, would you care to marry at once, and try the
      experiment of beginning life with me upon two hundred a year? I know it&rsquo;s
      very little, darling, for our wants and necessities, brought up as you and
      I have been: but Herr Max says, you know, it&rsquo;s as much as any one
      family ought ever to spend upon its own gratifications; and at any rate I
      dare say you and I could manage to be very happy upon it, at least for the
      present. In any case it would be better than being a governess. Will you
      risk it, Edie?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To me, Ernest,&rsquo; Edie answered with her unaffected simplicity, ‘it
      really seems quite a magnificent income. I don&rsquo;t suppose any of our
      friends or neighbours in Calcombe spend nearly as much as two hundred a
      year upon their own families.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes, they do, darling. But that isn&rsquo;t the only thing. Two
      hundred a year is a very different matter in quiet, old-world, little
      Calcombe and in a fashionable modern watering-place like Pilbury Regis. We
      shall have to live in lodgings, Edie, and live very quietly indeed; but
      even so I think it will be better than for you to go out and endure the
      humiliation of becoming a governess. Then I may understand that, if I can
      get this mastership, you&rsquo;ll consent to be married, Edie, before the
      end of September?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Ernest, that&rsquo;s dreadfully soon!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, it is, darling; but you must have a very quiet wedding; and I can&rsquo;t
      bear to leave you here now any longer without Harry to cheer and protect
      you. Shall we look upon it as settled?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie blushed and looked down as she answered almost inaudibly, ‘As you
      think best, dear Ernest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So that very evening Ernest sent off an application to Pilbury Regis,
      together with such testimonials as he had by him, mentioning at the same
      time his intention to marry, and his recent engagement at Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s.
      &lsquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t make a point about the University Prize,
      Edie,&rsquo; he said timidly; &lsquo;but I rather think they don&rsquo;t
      mean to insist upon it. I&rsquo;m afraid it may be put in to some extent
      mainly as a bait to attract parents. Advertisements are often so very
      dishonest. At any rate, we can only try; and if I get it, I shall be able
      to call you my little wife in September.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So soon after poor Harry&rsquo;s death he hardly liked to say much about
      how happy that consciousness would make him; but he sent off the letter
      with a beating heart, and waited anxiously for the head master&rsquo;s
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Maria,&rsquo; said Dr. Greatrex to his wife next morning, turning over
      the pile of letters at the breakfast table, &lsquo;who do you think has
      applied for the third mastership? Very lucky, really, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Considering that there are some thirty millions of people in England, I
      believe, Dr. Greatrex,&rsquo; said his wife with dignity, ‘that some
      seventy of those have answered your advertisement, and that you haven&rsquo;t
      yet given me an opportunity even of guessing which it is of them all, I&rsquo;m
      sure I can&rsquo;t say so far whether it&rsquo;s lucky or otherwise.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re pleased to be satirical, my dear,&rsquo; the doctor answered
      blandly; he was in too good a humour to pursue the opening further. ‘But
      no matter. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, then; it&rsquo;s young Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not Lady Le Breton&rsquo;s son!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Greatrex, forgetting
      her dignity in her surprise. &lsquo;Well, that certainly is very lucky.
      Now, if we could only get her to come down and stay with us for a week
      sometimes, after he&rsquo;s been here a little while, what a splendid
      advertisement it would be for the place, to be sure, Joseph!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Capital!&rsquo; the head master said, eyeing the letter complacently as
      he sipped his coffee. &lsquo;A perfect jewel of a master, I should say,
      from every possible point of view. Just the sort of person to attract
      parents and pupils. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce you to our third master,
      Mr. Le Breton; I hope Lady Le Breton was quite well when you heard from
      her last, Le Breton?&rdquo; and all that sort of thing. Depend upon it,
      Maria, there&rsquo;s nothing in the world that makes a middle-class parent&mdash;and
      our parents are unfortunately all middle-class&mdash;prick up his ears
      like the faintest suspicion or echo of a title. &ldquo;Very good school,&rdquo;
      he goes back and says to his wife immediately; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll send
      Tommy there; they have a master who&rsquo;s an honourable or something of
      the sort; sure to give the boys a thoroughly high gentlemanly tone.&rdquo;
      It&rsquo;s snobbery, I admit, sheer snobbery: but between ourselves,
      Maria, most people are snobs, and we have to live, professionally, by
      accommodating ourselves to their foolish prejudices.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘At the same time, doctor,&rsquo; said his wife severely, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think we ought to allow it too freely, at least with the door open.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re quite right, my dear,&rsquo; the head master answered
      submissively, rising at the same time to shut the door. &lsquo;But what
      makes this particular application all the better is that young Le Breton
      would come here straight from the Earl of Exmoor&rsquo;s where he has been
      acting as tutor to the son and heir, Viscount Lynmouth. That&rsquo;s
      really admirable, now, isn&rsquo;t it? Just consider the advantages of the
      situation. A doubtful parent comes to inspect the arrangements; sniffs at
      the dormitories, takes the gauge of the studies, snorts over the
      playground, condescends to approve of the fives courts. Then, after doing
      the usual Christian principles business and working in the high moral tone
      a little, we invite him to lunch, and young Le Breton to meet him. You
      remark casually in the most unconscious and natural fashion&mdash;I admit,
      my dear, that you do these little things much better than I do&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      talking of cricket, Mr. Le Breton, your old pupil, Lord Lynmouth, made a
      splendid score the other day at the Eton and Harrow.&rdquo; Fixes the
      wavering parent like a shot. &ldquo;Third master something or other in the
      peerage, and has been tutor to a son of Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s. Place to send
      your boys to if you want to make perfect gentlemen of them.&rdquo; I think
      we&rsquo;d better close at once with this young man&rsquo;s offer, Maria.
      He&rsquo;s got a very decent degree, too; a first in Mods and Greats;
      really very decent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But will he take a house-mastership do you think, doctor?&rsquo; asked
      the careful lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, he won&rsquo;t; he&rsquo;s married or soon going to be. We must let
      him off the house duty.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Married!&rsquo; said Mrs. Greatrex, turning it over cautiously. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s
      he going to marry, I wonder? I hope somebody presentable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, of course!&rsquo; Dr. Greatrex answered, as who should feel shocked
      at the bare suggestion that a young man of Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s
      antecedents could conceivably marry otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘His wife, or rather his wife that is to be, is a sister, he tells me, of
      that poor Mr. Oswald&mdash;the famous mathematician, you know, of Oriel&mdash;who
      got killed, you remember, by falling off the Matterhorn or somewhere, just
      the other day. You must have seen about it in the &ldquo;Times.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I remember,&rsquo; Mrs. Greatrex answered, in placid contentment; &lsquo;and
      I should say you can&rsquo;t do better than take him immediately. It&rsquo;d
      be an excellent thing for the school, certainly. As the third mastership&rsquo;s
      worth only two hundred a year, of course he can&rsquo;t intend to marry
      upon THAT; so he must have means of his own, which is always a good thing
      to encourage in an under-master: or if his wife has money, that comes in
      the end to the same thing. They&rsquo;ll take a house of their own, no
      doubt; and she&rsquo;ll probably entertain&mdash;very quietly, I daresay;
      still, a small dinner now and then gives a very excellent tone to the
      school in its own way. Social considerations, as I always say, Joseph, are
      all-important in school management; and I think we may take it for granted
      that Mr. Le Breton would be socially a real acquisition.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was shortly settled that Dr. Greatrex should write back accepting
      Ernest Le Breton as third master; and Mrs. Greatrex began immediately
      dropping stray allusions to &lsquo;Lady Le Breton, our new master&rsquo;s
      mother, you know,&rsquo; among her various acquaintance, especially those
      with rising young families. The doctor and she thought a good deal of this
      catch they were making in the person of Ernest Le Breton. Poor souls, they
      little knew what sort of social qualities they were letting themselves in
      for. A firebrand or a bombshell would really have been a less remarkable
      guest to drop down straight into the prim and proper orthodox society of
      Pilbury Regis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ernest received the letter in which Dr. Greatrex informed him that he
      might have the third mastership, he hardly knew how to contain his joy. He
      kissed Edie a dozen times over in his excitement, and sat up late making
      plans with her which would have been delightful but for poor Edie&rsquo;s
      lasting sorrow. In a short time it was all duly arranged, and Ernest began
      to think that he must go back to London for a day or two, to let Lady Le
      Breton hear of his change of plans, and got everything in order for their
      quiet wedding. He grudged the journey sadly, for he was beginning to
      understand now that he must take care of the pence for Edie&rsquo;s sake
      as well as for humanity&rsquo;s&mdash;his abstraction was individualising
      itself in concrete form&mdash;but he felt so much at least was demanded of
      him by filial duty, and, besides, he had one or two little matters to
      settle at Epsilon Terrace which could not so well be managed in his
      absence even by his trusty deputy, Ronald. So he ran up to town once more
      in a hurry, and dropped in as if nothing had happened, at his mother&rsquo;s
      house. It was no unusual matter for him to pass a fortnight at Wilton
      Place without finding time to call round at Epsilon Terrace to see Ronald,
      and his mother had not heard at all as yet of his recent change of
      engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Le Breton listened with severe displeasure to Ernest&rsquo;s account
      of his quarrel with Lord Exmoor. It was quite unnecessary and wrong, she
      said, to prevent Lynmouth from his innocent boyish amusements.
      Pigeon-shooting was practised by the very best people, and she was quite
      sure, therefore, there could be no harm of any sort in it. She believed
      the sport was countenanced, not only by bishops, but even by princes.
      Pigeons, she supposed, had been specially created by Providence for our
      use and enjoyment&mdash;&lsquo;their final cause being apparently the
      manufacture of pigeon-pie,&rsquo; Ronald suggested parenthetically: but we
      couldn&rsquo;t use them without killing them, unfortunately; and shooting
      was probably as painless a form of killing as any other. Peter or
      somebody, she distinctly remembered, had been specially commanded to
      arise, kill, and eat. To object to pigeon-shooting indeed, in Lady Le
      Breton&rsquo;s opinion, was clearly flying in the face of Providence. Of
      Ronald&rsquo;s muttered reference to five sparrows being sold for two
      farthings, and yet not one of them being forgotten, she would not
      condescend to take any notice. However, thank goodness, the fault was none
      of hers; she could wash her hands entirely of all responsibility in the
      matter. She had done her best to secure Ernest a good place in a
      thoroughly nice family, and if he chose to throw it up at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice for one of his own absurd communistical fads, it was happily none
      of her business. She was glad, at any rate, that he&rsquo;d got another
      berth, with a conscientious, earnest, Christian man like Dr. Greatrex.
      &lsquo;And indeed, Ernest,&rsquo; she said, returning once more to the
      pigeon-shooting question, &lsquo;even your poor dear papa, who was full of
      such absurd religious fancies, didn&rsquo;t think that sport was
      unchristian, I&rsquo;m certain; for I remember once, when we were
      quartered at Moozuffernugger in the North-West Provinces, he went out into
      a nullah near our compound one day, and with his own hand shot a
      man-eating tiger, which had carried off three little native children from
      the thanah; so that shows that he couldn&rsquo;t really object to sport;
      and I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to cast disrespect upon the memory of your
      own poor father!&rsquo;. All of which profound moral and religious
      observations Ernest, as in duty bound, received with the most respectful
      and acquiescent silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he had to approach the more difficult task of breaking to his
      mother his approaching marriage with Edie Oswald. He began the subject as
      delicately as he could, dwelling strongly upon poor Harry Oswald&rsquo;s
      excellent position as an Oxford tutor, and upon Herbert&rsquo;s visit with
      him to Switzerland&mdash;he knew his mother too well to suppose that the
      real merits of the Oswald family would impress her in any way, as compared
      with their accidental social status; and then he went on to speak as
      gently as possible about his engagement with little Edie. At this point,
      to his exceeding discomfiture, Lady Le Breton adopted the unusual tactics
      of bursting suddenly into a flood of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Ernest,&rsquo; she sobbed out inarticulately through her scented
      cambric handkerchief, &lsquo;for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t tell me
      that you&rsquo;ve gone and engaged yourself to that designing girl! Oh, my
      poor, poor, misguided boy! Is there really no way to save you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No way to save me!&rsquo; exclaimed Ernest, astonished and disconcerted
      by this unexpected outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, yes!&rsquo; Lady Le Breton went on, almost passionately. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t
      you manage somehow to get yourself out of it? I hope you haven&rsquo;t
      utterly compromised yourself! Couldn&rsquo;t dear Herbert go down to What&rsquo;s-his-name
      Pomeroy, and induce the father&mdash;a grocer, if I remember right&mdash;induce
      him, somehow or other, to compromise the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Compromise!&rsquo; cried Ernest, uncertain whether to laugh or be angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, compromise it!&rsquo; Lady Le Breton answered, endeavouring to calm
      herself. &lsquo;Of course that Machiavellian girl has tried to drag you
      into it; and the family have aided and abetted her; and you&rsquo;ve been
      weak and foolish&mdash;though not, I trust, wicked&mdash;and allowed them
      to get their net closed almost imperceptibly around you. But it isn&rsquo;t
      too late to withdraw even now, my poor, dear, deluded Ernest. It isn&rsquo;t
      too late to withdraw even now. Think of the disgrace and shame to the
      family! Think of your dear brothers and their blighted prospects! Don&rsquo;t
      allow this designing girl to draw you helplessly into such an ill-assorted
      marriage! Reflect upon your own future happiness! Consider what it will be
      to drag on years of your life with a woman, no longer perhaps externally
      attractive, whom you could never possibly respect or love for her own
      internal qualities! Don&rsquo;t go and wreck your own life, and your
      brothers&rsquo; lives, for any mistaken and Quixotic notions of false
      honour! You mayn&rsquo;t like to throw her over, after you&rsquo;ve once
      been inveigled into saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; (and the feeling, though
      foolish, does your heart credit); but reflect, my dear boy, such a
      promise, so obtained, can hardly be considered binding upon your
      conscience! I&rsquo;ve no doubt dear Herbert, who&rsquo;s a capital man of
      business, would get them readily enough to agree to a compromise or a
      compensation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear mother,'said Ernest white with indignation, but speaking very
      quietly, as soon as he could edge in a word, &lsquo;you quite
      misunderstand the whole question. Edie Oswald is a lady by nature, with
      all a lady&rsquo;s best feelings&mdash;I hate the word because of its
      false implications, but I can&rsquo;t use any other that will convey to
      you my meaning&mdash;and I love and admire and respect and worship her
      with all my heart and with all my soul. She hasn&rsquo;t inveigled me or
      set her cap at me, as you call it, in any way; she&rsquo;s the sweetest,
      timidest, most shrinking little thing that ever existed; on the contrary,
      it is I who have humbly asked her to accept me, because I know no other
      woman to whom I could give my whole heart so unreservedly. To tell you the
      truth, mother, with my ideas and opinions, I could hardly be happy with
      any girl of the class that you would call distinctively ladies: their
      class prejudices and their social predilections would jar and grate upon
      me at every turn. But Edie Oswald&rsquo;s a girl whom I could worship and
      love without any reserve&mdash;whom I can reverence for her beautiful
      character, her goodness, and her delicacy of feeling. She has honoured me
      by accepting me, and I&rsquo;m going to marry her at the end of this
      month, and I want, if possible, to get your consent to the marriage before
      I do so. She&rsquo;s a wife of whom I shall be proud in every way; I wish
      I could think she would have equal cause to be proud of her husband.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Le Breton threw herself once more into a paroxysm of tears. ‘Oh,
      Ernest,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;do spare me! do spare me! This is too
      wicked, too unfeeling, too cruel of you altogether! I knew already you
      were very selfish and heartless and headstrong, but I didn&rsquo;t know
      you were quite so unmanageable and so unkind as this. I appeal to your
      better nature&mdash;for you HAVE a better nature&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you
      have a better nature: you&rsquo;re MY son, and you can&rsquo;t be utterly
      devoid of good impulses. I appeal confidently to your better nature to
      throw off this unhappy, designing, wicked girl before it is too late! She
      has made you forget your duty to your mother, but not, I hope,
      irrevocably. Oh, my poor, dear, wandering boy, won&rsquo;t you listen to
      the voice of reason? won&rsquo;t you return once more like the prodigal
      son, to your neglected mother and your forgotten duty?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear mother,&rsquo; Ernest said, hardly knowing how to answer, &lsquo;you
      WILL persist in completely misunderstanding me. I love Edie Oswald with
      all my heart; I have promised to marry her, because she has done me the
      great and undeserved honour of accepting me as her future husband; and
      even if I wanted to break off the engagement (which it would break my own
      heart to do), I certainly couldn&rsquo;t break it off now without the most
      disgraceful and dishonourable wickedness. That is quite fixed and certain,
      and I can&rsquo;t go back upon it in any way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you insist, you unnatural boy,&rsquo; said Lady Le Breton, wiping
      her eyes, and assuming the air of an injured parent, &lsquo;you insist,
      against my express wish, in marrying this girl Osborne, or whatever you
      call her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I do, mother,&rsquo; Ernest answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In that case,&rsquo; said Lady Le Breton, coldly, &lsquo;I must beg of
      you that you won&rsquo;t bring this lady, whether as your wife or
      otherwise, under my roof. I haven&rsquo;t been accustomed to associate
      with the daughters of tradesmen, and I don&rsquo;t wish to associate with
      them now in any way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If so,&rsquo; Ernest said, very softly, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t remain under
      your roof myself any longer. I can go nowhere at all where my future wife
      will not be received on exactly the same terms that I am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you had bettor go,&rsquo; said Lady Le Breton, in her chilliest
      manner. &lsquo;Ronald, do me the favour to ring the bell for a cab for
      your brother Ernest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I shall walk, thank you, mother,&rsquo; said Ernest quietly. &lsquo;Good
      morning, dear Ronald.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald rose solemnly and opened the door for him. &lsquo;Therefore shall a
      man leave his father and mother,&rsquo; he said in his clear, soft voice,
      &lsquo;and shall cleave unto his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh.
      Amen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Le Breton darted a withering glance at her younger son as Ernest shut
      the door after him, and burst once more into a sudden flood of
      uncontrollable tears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; &lsquo;COME YE OUT AND BE YE SEPARATE.&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s London lodgings were wonderfully snug and
      comfortable for the second floor of a second-rate house in a small retired
      side street near the Embankment at Chelsea. He had made the most of the
      four modest little rooms, with his quick taste and his deft, cunning
      fingers:&mdash;four rooms, or rather boxes, one might almost call them; a
      bedroom each for himself and the Progenitor; a wee sitting-room for meals
      and music&mdash;the two Berkeleys would doubtless as soon have gone
      without the one as the other; and a tiny study where Arthur might work
      undisturbed at his own desk upon his new and original magnum opus,
      destined to form the great attraction of the coming season at the
      lately-opened Ambiguities Theatre. Things had prospered well with the
      former Oxford curate during the last twelve-month. His cantata at Leeds
      had proved a wonderful success, and had finally induced him to remove to
      London, and take to composing as a regular profession. He had his qualms
      about it, to be sure, as one who had put his hand to the plough and then
      turned back; he did not feel quite certain in his own mind how far he was
      justified in giving up the more spiritual for the more worldly calling;
      but natures like Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s move rather upon passing feeling
      than upon deeper sentiment; and had he not ample ground, he asked himself,
      for this reconsideration of the monetary position? He had the Progenitor&rsquo;s
      happiness to insure before thinking of the possible injury to his
      non-existent parishioners. If he was doing Whippingham Parva or
      Norton-cum-Sutton out of an eloquent and valuable potential rector, if he
      was depriving the Church in the next half-century of a dignified and
      portly prospective archdeacon, he is at least making his father&rsquo;s
      last days brighter and more comfortable than his early ones had ever been.
      And then, was not music, too, in its own way, a service, a liturgy, a
      worship? Surely he could do higher good to men&rsquo;s souls&mdash;as they
      call them&mdash;to whatever little spark of nobler and better fire there
      might lurk within those dull clods of common clay he saw all around him&mdash;by
      writing such a work as his Leeds cantata, than by stringing together for
      ever those pretty centos of seventeenth-century conceits and
      nineteenth-century doubts or hesitations which he was accustomed to call
      his sermons! Whatever came of it, he must give up the miserable pittance
      of a curacy, and embrace the career open to the musical talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he fitted up his little Chelsea rooms in his own economically sumptuous
      fashion with some bits of wall paper, a few jugs and vases, and an etching
      or two after Meissonier; planted the Progenitor down comfortably in a
      large easy-chair, with a melodious fiddle before him; and set to work
      himself to do what he could towards elevating the British stage and
      pocketing a reasonable profit on his own account from that familiar and
      ever-rejuvenescent process. He was quite in earnest, now, about producing
      a totally new effect of his own; and believing in his work, as a good
      workman ought to do, he wrought at it indefatigably and well in the
      retirement of a second-pair back, overlooking a yardful of fluttering
      clothes, and a fine skyline vista of bare, yellowish brick chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What part are you working at to-day, Artie?&rsquo; said the old
      shoemaker, looking over his son&rsquo;s shoulder at the blank music paper
      before him. &lsquo;Quartette of Biological Professors, eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, father,&rsquo; Berkeley answered with a smile. &lsquo;How do you
      think it runs now?&rsquo; and he hummed over a few lines of his own words,
      set with a quaint lilt to his own inimitable and irresistible music:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    And though in unanimous chorus
    We mourn that from ages before us
    No single enaliosaurus
        To-day should survive,

    Yet joyfully may we bethink us,
    With the earliest mammal to link us,
    We still have the ornithorhyncus
        Extant and alive!
</pre>
    <p>
      ‘How do you think the score does for that, father, eh? Catching air
      rather, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not a better air in the whole piece, Artie; but, my boy, who do you think
      will ever understand the meaning of the words. The gods themselves won&rsquo;t
      know what you&rsquo;re driving at.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I&rsquo;m going to strike out a new line, Daddie dear. I&rsquo;m not
      going to play to the gallery; I mean to play to the stalls and boxes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Was there ever such a born aristocrat as this young parson is!&rsquo;
      cried the old man, lifting up both his hands with a playful gesture of
      mock-deprecation. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s hopeless! He&rsquo;s terrible! He&rsquo;s
      incorrigible! Why, you unworthy son of a respectable Paddington shoemaker,
      if even the intelligent British artizans in the gallery don&rsquo;t
      understand you, how the dickens do you suppose the oiled and curled
      Assyrian bulls in the stalls and boxes will have a glimmering idea of what
      you&rsquo;re driving at? The supposition&rsquo;s an insult to the popular
      intelligence&mdash;in other words, to me, sir, your Progenitor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Berkeley laughed. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, father,&rsquo; he
      said, holding up the page of manuscript music at arm&rsquo;s length
      admiringly before him; &lsquo;but I do know one thing: this comic opera of
      mine is going to be a triumphant success.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So I&rsquo;ve thought ever since you began it, Artie. You see, my boy,
      there&rsquo;s a great many points in its favour. In the first place you
      can write your own libretto, or whatever you call it; and you know I&rsquo;ve
      always held that though that Wagner man was wrong in practice&mdash;a most
      inflated thunder-bomb, his Lohengrin&mdash;yet he was right in theory,
      right in theory, Artie; every composer ought to be his own poet. Well,
      then, again, you&rsquo;ve got a certain peculiar vein of humour of your
      own, a kind of delicate semi-serious burlesque turn about you that&rsquo;s
      quite original, both in writing and in composing; you&rsquo;re a humourist
      in verse and a humourist in music, that&rsquo;s the long and the short of
      it. Now, you&rsquo;ve hit upon a fresh lode of dramatic ore in this opera
      of yours, and if my judgment goes for anything, it&rsquo;ll bring the
      house down the first evening. I&rsquo;m a bit of a critic, Artie; by hook
      or by crook, you know, paper or money, I&rsquo;ve heard every good opera,
      comic or serious, that&rsquo;s been given in London these last thirty
      years, and I flatter myself I know something by this time about operatic
      criticism.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re wrong about Wagner, father,&rsquo; said Arthur, still
      glancing with paternal partiality at his sheet of manuscript: &lsquo;Lohengrin&rsquo;s
      a very fine work, a grand work, I assure you. I won&rsquo;t let you run it
      down. But, barring that, I think you&rsquo;re pretty nearly right in your
      main judgment. I&rsquo;m not modest, and it strikes me somehow that I&rsquo;ve
      invented a genre. That&rsquo;s about what it comes to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you&rsquo;d confine yourself to your native tongue, Mr. Parson, your
      ignorant old father might have some chance of agreeing or disagreeing with
      you; but as he doesn&rsquo;t even know what the thingumbob you say you&rsquo;ve
      invented may happen to be, he can&rsquo;t profitably continue the
      discussion of that subject. However, my only fear is that you may perhaps
      be writing above the heads of the audience. Not in the music, Artie; they
      can&rsquo;t fail to catch that; it rings in one&rsquo;s head like the song
      of a hedge warbler&mdash;tirree, tirree, lu-lu-lu, la-la, tirree, tu-whit,
      tu-whoo, tra-la-la&mdash;but in the words and the action. I&rsquo;m half
      afraid that&rsquo;ll be over their heads, even in the gallery. What do you
      think you&rsquo;ll finally call it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m hesitating, Daddy, between &ldquo;Evolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
      Primate of Fiji.&rdquo; Which do you recommend&mdash;tell me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Primate, by all means,&rsquo; said the old man gaily. &lsquo;And you
      still mean to open with the debate in the Fijian Parliament on the
      Deceased Grandmother&rsquo;s Second Cousin Bill?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, I don&rsquo;t, Daddy. I&rsquo;ve written a new first scene this week,
      in which the President of the Board of Trade remonstrates with the
      mermaids on their remissness in sending their little ones to the Fijian
      Board Schools, in order to receive primary instruction in the art of
      swimming. I&rsquo;ve got a capital chorus of mermaids to balance the other
      chorus of Biological Professors on the Challenger Expedition. I consider
      it&rsquo;s a happy cross between Ariosto and Aristophanes. If you like, I&rsquo;ll
      give you the score, and read over the words to you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do,&rsquo;
      said the old man, settling himself down in comfort in his son&rsquo;s
      easy-chair, and assuming the sternest air of an impartial critic. Arthur
      Berkeley read on dramatically, in his own clever airy fashion, suiting
      accent and gesture to the subject matter through the whole first three
      acts of that exquisitely humorous opera, the Primate of Fiji. Sometimes he
      hummed the tune over to himself as he went; sometimes he played a few
      notes upon his flute by way of striking the key-note; sometimes he rose
      from his seat in his animation, and half acted the part he was reading
      with almost unconscious and spontaneous mimicry. He read through the
      famous song of the President of the Local Government Board, that everybody
      has since heard played by every German band at the street corners; through
      the marvellously catching chorus of the superannuated tide-waiters;
      through the culminating dialogue between the London Missionary Society&rsquo;s
      Agent and the Hereditary Grand Sacrificer to the King of Fiji. Of course
      the recital lacked everything of the scenery and dresses that give it so
      much vogue upon the stage; but it had at least the charmingly suggestive
      music, the wonderful linking of sound to sense, the droll and inimitable
      intermixture of the plausible and the impossible which everybody has
      admired and laughed at in the acted piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old shoemaker listened in breathless silence, keeping his eye fixed
      steadily all the time upon the clean copy of the score. Only once he made
      a wry face to himself, and that was in the chorus to the debate in the
      Fijian Parliament on the proposal to leave off the practice of obligatory
      cannibalism. The conservative party were of opinion that if you began by
      burying instead of eating your deceased wife, you might end by the
      atrocious practice of marrying your deceased wife&rsquo;s sister; and they
      opposed the revolutionary measure in that well known refrain:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Of change like this we&rsquo;re naturally chary,
    Nolumus leges Fijiae mutari.
</pre>
    <p>
      That passage evidently gave the Progenitor deep pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stick to your own language, my boy,&rsquo; he murmured; &lsquo;stick to
      your own language. The Latin may be very fine, but the gallery wil never
      understand it.&rsquo; However, when Arthur finished at last, he drew a
      long breath, and laid down the roll of manuscript with an involuntary
      little cry of half-stifled applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Artie,&rsquo; he said rising from the chair slowly, &lsquo;Artie, that&rsquo;s
      not so bad for a parson, I can tell you. I hope the Archbishop won&rsquo;t
      be tempted to cite you for displaying an amount of originality unworthy of
      your cloth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Father,&rsquo; said Arthur, suddenly, after a short pause, with a tinge
      of pensiveness in his tone that was not usual with him, in speaking at
      least; &lsquo;Father, I often think I ought never to have become a parson
      at all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, my boy,&rsquo; said the old man, looking up at him sharply with his
      keen eyes, &lsquo;I knew that long ago. You&rsquo;ve never really believed
      in the thing, and you oughtn&rsquo;t to have gone in for it from the very
      beginning. It was the music, and the dresses, and the decorations that
      enticed you, Artie, and not the doctrine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur turned towards him with a pained expression. &lsquo;Father,&rsquo;
      he said, half reproachfully, &lsquo;Father, dear father, don&rsquo;t talk
      to me like that. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m so shallow or so dishonest as
      to subscribe to opinions I don&rsquo;t believe in. It&rsquo;s a curious
      thing to say, a curious thing in this unbelieving age, and I&rsquo;m half
      ashamed to say it, even to you; but do you know, father, I really do
      believe it: in my very heart of hearts, I fancy I believe every word of
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man listened to him compassionately and tenderly, as a woman
      listens to the fears and troubles of a little child. To him, that plain
      confession of faith was, in truth, a wonder and a stumbling-block. Good,
      simple-hearted, easy-going, logical-minded, sceptical shoemaker that he
      was, with his head all stuffed full of Malthus, and John Stuart Mill, and
      political economy, and the hard facts of life and science, how could he
      hope to understand the complex labyrinth of metaphysical thinking, and
      childlike faith, and aesthetic attraction, and historical authority, which
      made a sensitive man like Arthur Berkeley, in his wayward, half-serious,
      emotional fashion, turn back lovingly and regretfully to the fair old
      creed that his father had so long deserted? How strange that Artie, a
      full-grown male person, with all the learning of the schools behind him,
      should relapse at last into these childish and exploded mediaeval
      superstitions! How incredible that, after having been brought up from his
      babyhood upward on the strong meat of the agnostic philosophers, he should
      fall back in his manhood on the milk for babes administered to him by
      orthodox theology! The simple-minded old sceptic could hardly credit it,
      now that Arthur told him so with his own lips, though he had more than
      once suspected it when he heard him playing sacred music with that last
      touch of earnestness in his execution which only the sincerest conviction
      and most intimate realisation of its import can ever give. Ah well, ah
      well, good sceptical old shoemaker; there are perhaps more things in
      heaven and earth and in the deep soul of man than are dreamt of in your
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though the avowal shocked and disappointed him a little, the old
      man could not find it in his heart to say one word of sorrow or
      disapproval, far less of ridicule or banter, to his dearly loved boy. He
      felt instinctively, what Herbert Le Breton could not feel, that this
      sentimental tendency of his son&rsquo;s, as he thought it, lay far too
      deep and seemed far too sacred for mere argument or common discussion.
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; he said to himself softly, &lsquo;Artie&rsquo;s
      emotional side has got the better of his intellectual. I brought him up
      without telling him any thing of these things, except negatively, and by
      way of warning against superstitious tendencies; and when he went to
      Oxford, and saw the doctrines tricked out in all the authority of a great
      hierarchy, with its cathedrals, and chapels, and choirs, and altars, and
      robes, and fal-lal finery, it got the better of him; got the better of
      him, very naturally. Artie&rsquo;s a cleverer fellow than his old father&mdash;had
      more education, and so on; and I&rsquo;m fond of him, very fond of him;
      but his logical faculty isn&rsquo;t quite straight, somehow: he lets his
      feelings have too much weight and prominence against his calmer reason! I
      can easily understand how, with his tastes and leanings, the clericals
      should have managed to get a hold over him. The clericals are such
      insinuating cunning fellows. A very impressionable boy Artie was, always;
      the poetical temperament and the artistic temperament always is
      impressionable, I suppose; but shoemaking certainly does develop the
      logical faculties. Seems as though the logical faculties were situated in
      the fore-part of the brain, as they mark them out on the phrenological
      heads; and the leaning forward that gives us the shoemaker&rsquo;s
      forehead must tend to enlarge them&mdash;give them plenty of room to
      expand and develop!&rsquo; Saying which thing to himself musingly, the
      father took his son&rsquo;s hand gently in his, and only smoothed it
      quietly as he looked deep into Arthur&rsquo;s eyes, without uttering a
      single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Arthur Berkeley, he sat silent, too, half averting his face from
      his father&rsquo;s gaze, and feeling a little blush of shame upon his
      cheek at having been surprised unexpectedly into such an unwonted avowal.
      How could he ever expect his father to understand the nature of his
      feelings! To him, good old man that he was, all these things were just
      matters of priestcraft and obscurantism&mdash;fables invented by the
      ecclesiastical mind as a means of getting fat livings and comfortable
      deaneries out of the public pocket. And, indeed, Arthur was well
      accustomed at Oxford to keeping his own opinions to himself on such
      subjects. What chance of sympathy or response was there for such a man as
      he in that coldly critical and calmly deliberative learned society? Not,
      of course, that all Oxford was wholly given over even then to extreme
      agnosticism. There were High Churchmen, and Low Churchmen, and Broad
      Churchmen enough, to be sure: men learned in the Fathers, and the Canons,
      and the Acts of the General Councils; men ready to argue on the
      intermediate state, or on the three witnesses, or on the heretical nature
      of the Old Catholic schism; men prepared with minute dogmatic opinions
      upon every conceivable or inconceivable point of abstract theology. There
      were people who could trace the Apostolic succession of the old Cornish
      bishops, and people who could pronounce authoritatively upon the exact
      distinction between justification and remission of sins. But for all these
      things Arthur Berkeley cared nothing. Where, then, among those learned
      exegetical theologians, was there room for one whose belief was a matter,
      not of reason and argument, but of feeling and of sympathy? He did not
      want to learn what the Council of Trent had said about such and such a
      dogma; he wanted to be conscious of an inner truth, to find the world
      permeated by an informing righteousness, to know himself at one with the
      inner essence of the entire universe. And though he could never feel sure
      whether it was all illusion or not, he had hungered and thirsted after
      believing it, till, as he told his father timidly that day, he actually
      did believe it somehow in his heart of hearts. Let us not seek to probe
      too deeply into those inner recesses, whose abysmal secrets are never
      perfectly clear even to the introspective eyes of the conscious
      self-dissector himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause Arthur spoke again. He spoke this time in a very low voice,
      as one afraid to open his soul too much, even to his father. ‘Dear, dear
      father,&rsquo; he said, releasing his hand softly, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t
      quite understand what I mean about it. It isn&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t
      believe, or try to believe, or hope I believe, that I think I ought never
      to have become a parson. In my way, as in a glass, darkly, I do strive my
      best to believe, though perhaps my belief is hardly more in its way than
      Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s unbelieving. I do want to think that this great
      universe we see around us isn&rsquo;t all a mistake and an abortion. I
      want to find a mind and an order and a purpose in it; and, perhaps because
      I want it, I make myself believe that I have really found it. In that hope
      and belief, with the ultimate object of helping on whatever is best and
      truest in the world, I took orders. But I feel now that it was an error
      for me. I&rsquo;m not the right man to make a parson. There are men who
      are born for that rôle; men who know how to conduct themselves in it
      decently and in seemly fashion; men who can quietly endure all its
      restraints, and can fairly rise to the height of all its duties. But I can&rsquo;t.
      I was intended for something lighter and less onerous than that. If I stop
      in the Church I shall do no good to myself or to it; if I come out of it,
      I shall make both parties freer, and shall be able to do more good in my
      own generation. And so, father, for the very same reasons that made me go
      into it, I mean to come out again. Not in any quarrel with it, nor as
      turning my back upon it, but just as the simple acknowledgment of a
      mistaken calling. It wouldn&rsquo;t be seemly, for example, for a parson
      to write comic operas. But I feel I can do more good by writing comic
      operas than by talking dogmatically about things I hardly understand to
      people who hardly understand me. So before I get this opera acted I mean
      to leave off my white tie, and be known in future, henceforth and for
      ever, as plain Arthur Berkeley.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old shoemaker listened in respectful silence. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      for me, Artie,&rsquo; he said, as his son finished, &lsquo;to stand
      between a man and his conscience. As John Stuart Mill says in his essay on
      &ldquo;Liberty,&rdquo; we must allow full play to every man&rsquo;s
      individuality. Wonderful man, John Stuart Mill; I understand his
      grandfather was a shoemaker. Well, I won&rsquo;t talk with you about the
      matter of conviction; but I never wanted you to be a parson, and I shall
      feel all the happier myself when you&rsquo;ve ceased to be one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I,&rsquo; said Arthur, &lsquo;shall feel all the freer; but if I had
      been able to remain where I was, I should have felt all the worthier, for
      all that.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; A QUIET WEDDING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fate was adverse for the moment to Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s well meant
      designs for shuffling off the trammels of his ecclesiastical habit. He was
      destined to appear in public at least once more, not only in the black
      coat and white tie of his everyday professional costume, but even in the
      flowing snowy surplice of a solemn and decorous spiritual function. The
      very next morning&rsquo;s post brought him a little note from Ernest Le
      Breton specially begging him, in his own name and Edie&rsquo;s, to come
      down to Calcombe Pomeroy, and officiate as parson at their approaching
      wedding. The note had cost Ernest a conscientious struggle, for he would
      have personally preferred to be married at a Registry Office, as being
      more in accordance with the duties of a good citizen, and savouring less
      of effete ecclesiastical superstition; but he felt he couldn&rsquo;t even
      propose such a step to Edie; she wouldn&rsquo;t have considered herself
      married at all, unless she were married quite regularly by a duly
      qualified clerk in holy orders of the Church of England as by law
      established. Already, indeed, Ernest was beginning to recognise with a
      sigh that if he was going to live in the world at all, he must do so by
      making at least a partial sacrifice of political consistency. You may step
      out of your own century, if you choose, yourself, but you can&rsquo;t get
      all the men and women with whom you come in contact to step out of it also
      in unison just to please you.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ernest had sat down reluctantly to his desk, and consented to ask
      Arthur Berkeley to assist at the important ceremony in his professional
      clerical capacity. If he was going to have a medicine man or a priest at
      all to marry him to the girl of his choice&mdash;a barbaric survival, at
      the best, he thought it&mdash;he would, at any rate, prefer having his
      friend Arthur&mdash;a good man and true&mdash;to having the fat,
      easy-going, purse-proud rector of the parish; the younger son of a wealthy
      family who had gone into the Church for the sake of the living, and who
      rolled sumptuously down the long hilly High Street every day in his
      comfortable carriage, leaning back with his fat hands folded complacently
      over his ample knees, and gazing abstractedly, with his little pigs&rsquo;-eyes
      half buried in his cheek, at the beautiful prospect afforded him by the
      broad livery-covered backs of his coachman and his footman. Ernest could
      never have consented to lot that lazy, overfed, useless encumbrance on a
      long-suffering commonwealth, that idle gorger of dainty meats and choice
      wines from the tithes of the tolling, suffering people, bear any part in
      what was after all the most solemn and serious contract of his whole
      lifetime. And, to say the truth, Edie quite agreed with him on that point,
      too. Though her moral indignation against poor, useless, empty-headed old
      Mr. Walters didn&rsquo;t burn quite so fierce or so clear as Ernest&rsquo;s&mdash;she
      regarded the fat old parson, indeed, rather from the social point of view,
      as a ludicrously self-satisfied specimen of the lower stages of humanity,
      than from the political point of view, as a greedy swallower of large
      revenues for small work inefficiently performed&mdash;she would still have
      felt that his presence at her wedding jarred and grated on all the finer
      sensibilities of her nature, as out of accord with the solemn and tender
      associations of that supreme moment. To have been married by prosy old Mr.
      Walters, to have taken the final benediction on the greatest act of her
      life from those big white fat fingers, would have spoilt the reminiscence
      of the wedding day for her as long as she lived. But when Ernest suggested
      Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s name to her, she acquiesced with all her heart in
      the happy selection. She liked Berkeley better than anybody else she had
      ever met, except Ernest; and she knew that his presence would rather add
      one more bright association to the day than detract from it in the coming
      years. Her poor little wedding would want all the additions that friends
      could make to its cheerfulness, to get over the lasting gloom and blank of
      dear Harry&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You will come and help us, I know, Berkeley,&rsquo; Ernest wrote to
      Arthur in his serious fashion. &lsquo;We feel there is nobody else we
      should so like to have present at our wedding as yourself. Come soon, too,
      for there are lots of things I want to talk over with you. It&rsquo;s a
      very solemn responsibility, getting married: you have to take upon
      yourself the duty of raising up future citizens for the state; and with
      our present knowledge of how nature works through the laws of heredity,
      you have to think whether you two who contemplate marriage are well fitted
      to act as parents to the generations that are to be. When I remember that
      all my own faults and failings may be handed on relentlessly to those that
      come after us&mdash;built up in the very fibre of their being&mdash;I am
      half appalled at my own temerity. Then, again, there is the inexorable
      question of money; is it prudent or is it wrong of us to marry on such an
      uncertainty? I&rsquo;m afraid that Schurz and Malthas would tell us&mdash;very
      wrong. I have turned over these things by myself till I&rsquo;m tired of
      arguing them out in my own head, and I want you to come down beforehand,
      so as to cheer me up a bit with your lighter and brighter philosophy. On
      the very eve of my marriage, I&rsquo;m somehow getting dreadfully
      pessimistic.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur read the letter through impatiently and crumpled it up in his hands
      with a gesture of despondency. &lsquo;Poor little Miss Butterfly,&rsquo;
      he said to himself, pityingly, &lsquo;was there ever such an abstraction
      of an ethical unit as this good, solemn, self-torturing Ernest! How will
      she ever live with him? How will he ever live with her? Poor little soul!
      Harry is gone like the sunshine out of her life; and now this
      well-meaning, gloomy, conscientious cloud comes caressingly to overspread
      her with the shadowing pall of its endless serious doubts and hesitations.
      Fancy a man who has won little Miss Butterfly&rsquo;s heart&mdash;dear
      little Miss Butterfly&rsquo;s gay, laughing, tender little heart&mdash;writing
      such a letter as that to the friend who&rsquo;s going to marry them! Upon
      my word, I&rsquo;ve half a mind to go into the concientious scruples
      business on my own account! Have I any right to be a party to fettering
      poor airy fairy little Miss Butterfly, with a heavy iron chain for life
      and always, to this great lumbering elephantine moral Ernest? Am I
      justified in tying the cable round her dainty little neck with a silken
      thread, and then fastening it round his big leg with rivets of hardened
      steel on the patent Bessemer process? If a couple of persons, duly called
      by banns in their own respective parishes, or furnished with the right
      reverend&rsquo;s perquisite, a licence, come to me, a clerk in holy
      orders, and ask me to marry them, I&rsquo;ve a vague idea that unless I
      comply I lay myself open to the penalties of praemunire, or something else
      equally awful and mysterious. But if the couple write and ask me to come
      down into Devonshire and marry them, that&rsquo;s quite another matter. I
      can lawfully answer, &lsquo;Non possumus.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a fine
      ecclesiastical ring, by the way, about answering &lsquo;Non possumus;&rsquo;
      it sums up the entire position of the Church in a nutshell! Well, I doubt
      whether I ought to go; but as a matter of friendship, I&rsquo;ll throw
      overboard my poor conscience. It&rsquo;s used to the process by this time,
      no doubt, like eels to skinning; and as Hudibras says,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    However tender it may be,
    &lsquo;Tis passing blind where &lsquo;twill not see.

      If she&rsquo;d only have taken ME, now, who knows but I might in time have
      risen to be a Prebendary or even a Dean? &lsquo;They that have used the

      wrote to Timothy once; but it&rsquo;s not so now, it&rsquo;s not so now;
      preferment goes by favour, and the deacon must e&rsquo;en shift as best he
      can on his own account.&rsquo; So, in the end, Arthur packed up his
      surplice in his little handbag, and took his way peacefully down to
      Calcombe Pomeroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very quiet, almost a sombre wedding, for the poor Oswalds were
      still enveloped in the lasting gloom of their great loss, and not much
      outward show or preparation, such as the female heart naturally delights
      in, could possibly be made under these painful circumstances. Still, all
      the world of Calcombe came to see little Miss Oswald married to the grave
      gentleman from Oxford; and most of them gave her their hearty good wishes,
      for Edie was a general favourite with gentle and simple throughout the
      whole borough. Herbert was there, like a decorous gentleman, to represent
      the bridegroom&rsquo;s family, and so was Ronald, who had slipped away
      from London without telling Lady Le Breton, for fear of another
      distressful scone at the last moment. Arthur Berkeley read the service in
      his beautiful impressive manner, and looked his part well in his flowing
      white surplice. But as he uttered the solemn words, &lsquo;Whom God hath
      joined together, let no man put asunder,&rsquo; the musical ring of his
      own voice sounded to his heart like the knell of his own one love&mdash;the
      funeral service over the only romance he could ever mix in throughout his
      whole lifetime. Poor fellow, he had taken the duty upon him with all
      friendly heartiness; but he felt an awful and lonely feeling steal over
      him when it was all finished, and when he knew that his little Miss
      Butterfly was now Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s lawful wife for ever and ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vestry, after signing the books, Herbert and Ronald and some of the
      others insisted on their ancient right of kissing the bride in good old
      English fashion. But Arthur did not. It would not have been loyal. He felt
      in his heart that he had loved little Miss Butterfly too deeply himself
      for that; to claim a kiss would be abusing the formal dues of his
      momentary position. Henceforth he would not even think of her to himself
      in that little pet name of his brief Oxford dream: he would call her
      nothing in his own mind but Mrs. Le Breton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie&rsquo;s simple little presents were all arranged in the tiny parlour
      behind the shop. Most of them were from her own personal friends: a few
      were from the gentry of the surrounding neighbourhood: but there were two
      handsomer than the rest: they came from outside the narrow little circle
      of Calcombe Pomeroy society. One was a plain gold bracelet from Arthur
      Berkeley; and on the gold of the inner face, though neither Edie nor
      Ernest noticed it, he had lightly cut with his knife on the soft metal the
      one word, &lsquo;Frustra.&rsquo; The other was a dressing-case, with a
      little card inside, &lsquo;Miss Oswald, from Lady Hilda Tregellis.&rsquo;
      Hilda had heard of Ernest&rsquo;s approaching wedding from Herbert (who
      took an early opportunity of casually lunching at Dunbude, in order to
      show that he mustn&rsquo;t be identified with his socialistic brother);
      and the news had strangely proved a slight salve to poor Hilda&rsquo;s
      wounded vanity&mdash;or, perhaps it would be fairer to say, to her
      slighted higher instincts. &lsquo;A country grocer&rsquo;s daughter!&rsquo;
      she said to herself: &lsquo;the sister of a great mathematical scholar!
      How very original of him to think of marrying a grocer&rsquo;s daughter!
      Why, of course, he must have been engaged to her all along before he came
      here! And even if he hadn&rsquo;t been, one might have known at once that
      such a man as he is would never go and marry a girl whose name&rsquo;s in
      the peerage, when he could strike out a line for himself by marrying a
      grocer&rsquo;s daughter. I really like him better than ever for it. I must
      positively send her a little present. They&rsquo;ll be as poor as church
      mice, I&rsquo;ve no doubt. I ought to send her something that&rsquo;ll be
      practically useful.&rsquo; And by way of sending something practically
      useful, Lady Hilda chose at last a handsome silver-topped Russia leather
      dressing-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not such a wedding as Edie had pictured to herself in her first
      sweet maidenly fancies; but still, when they drove away alone in the
      landau from the side-door of the Red Lion to Calcombe Road Station, she
      felt a quiet pride and security in her heart from the fact that she was
      now the wedded wife of a man she loved so dearly as Ernest Le Breton. And
      even Ernest so far conquered his social scruples that he took first-class
      tickets, for the first time in his life, to Ilfracombe, where they were to
      spend their brief and hasty fragment of a poor little honeymoon. It&rsquo;s
      so extremely hard to be a consistent socialist where women are concerned,
      especially on the very day of your own wedding!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; INTO THE FIRE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘Let me see, Le Breton,&rsquo; Dr. Greatrex observed to the new master,
      ‘you&rsquo;ve taken rooms for yourself in West Street for the present&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      take a house on the parade by-and-by, no doubt. Now, which church do you
      mean to go to?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, really,&rsquo; Ernest answered, taken a little aback at the
      suddenness of the question, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to think about
      it yet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor frowned slightly. &lsquo;Not had time to think about it,&rsquo;
      he repeated, rather severely. &lsquo;Not had time to think about such a
      serious question as your particular place of worship! You quite surprise
      me. Well, if you&rsquo;ll allow me to make a suggestion in the matter it
      would be that you and Mrs. Le Breton should take seats, for the present at
      least, at St. Martha&rsquo;s. The parish church is high, decidedly high,
      and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend you to go there; most of our parents don&rsquo;t
      approve of it. You&rsquo;re an Oxford man, I know, and so I suppose you&rsquo;re
      rather high yourself; but in this particular matter I would strongly
      advise you to subordinate your own personal feelings to the parents&rsquo;
      wishes. Then there&rsquo;s St. Jude&rsquo;s; St. Jude&rsquo;s is
      distinctly low&mdash;quite Evangelical in fact: indeed, I may say,
      scarcely what I should consider sound church principles at all in any way;
      and I think you ought most certainly to avoid it sedulously. Evangelicism
      is on the decline at present in Pilbury Regis. As to St. Barnabas&mdash;Barabbas
      they call it generally, a most irreverent joke, but, of course, inevitable&mdash;Barabbas
      is absolutely Ritualistic. Many of our parents object to it most strongly.
      But St. Martha&rsquo;s is a quiet, moderate, inoffensive church in every
      respect&mdash;sound and sensible, and free from all extremes. You can give
      no umbrage to anybody, even the most cantankerous, by going to St. Martha&rsquo;s.
      The High Church people fraternise with it on the one hand, and the
      moderate church people fraternise with it on the other, while as to the
      Evangelicals and the dissenters, they hardly contribute any boys to the
      school, or if they do, they don&rsquo;t object to unobtrusive church
      principles. Indeed, my experience has been, Le Breton, that even the most
      rabid dissenters prefer to have their sons educated by a sound, moderate,
      high-principled, and, if I may say so, neutral-tinted church clergyman.&rsquo;
      And the doctor complacently pulled his white tie straight before the big
      gilt-framed drawing-room mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then, again,&rsquo; the doctor went on placidly in a bland tone of mild
      persuasion, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s the question of politics. Politics are a
      very ticklish matter, I can assure you, in Pilbury Regis. Have you any
      fixed political opinions of your own, Le Breton, or are you waiting to
      form them till you&rsquo;ve had some little experience in your profession?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My opinions,&rsquo; Ernest answered timidly, &lsquo;so far as they can be
      classed under any of the existing political formulas at all, are decidedly
      Liberal&mdash;I may even say Radical.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor bit his lip and frowned severely. &lsquo;Radical,&rsquo; he
      said, slowly, with a certain delicate tinge of acerbity in his tone. ‘That&rsquo;s
      bad. If you will allow me to interpose in the matter, I should strongly
      advise you, for your own sake, to change them at once and entirely. I don&rsquo;t
      object to moderate Liberalism&mdash;perhaps as many as one-third of our
      parents are moderate Liberals; but decidedly the most desirable form of
      political belief for a successful schoolmaster is a quiet and gentlemanly,
      but unswerving Conservatism. I don&rsquo;t say you ought to be an
      uncompromising old-fashioned Tory&mdash;far from it: that alienates not
      only the dissenters, but even the respectable middle-class Liberals. What
      is above all things expected in a schoolmaster is a central position in
      politics, so to speak&mdash;a careful avoidance of all extremes&mdash;a
      readiness to welcome all reasonable progress, while opposing in a
      conciliatory spirit all revolutionary or excessive changes&mdash;in short,
      an attitude of studied moderation. That, if you will allow me to advise
      you, Le Breton, is the sort of thing, you may depend upon it, that most
      usually meets the wishes of the largest possible number of pupils&rsquo;
      parents.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; Ernest answered, as respectfully as possible,
      &lsquo;my political convictions are too deeply seated to be subordinated
      to my professional interests.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Eh! What!&rsquo; the doctor cried sharply. &lsquo;Subordinate your
      principles to your personal interests! Oh, pray don&rsquo;t mistake me so
      utterly as that! Not at all, not at all, my dear Le Breton. I don&rsquo;t
      mean that for the shadow of a second. What I mean is rather this,&rsquo;
      and here the doctor cleared his throat and pulled round his white tie a
      second time, &lsquo;that a schoolmaster, considering attentively what is
      best for his pupils, mark you&mdash;we all exist for our pupils, you know,
      my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t we?&mdash;a schoolmaster should avoid such
      action as may give any unnecessary scandal, you see, or seem to clash with
      the ordinary opinion of the pupils&rsquo; parents. Of course, if your
      views are fully formed, and are of a mildly Liberal complexion (put it so,
      I beg of you, and don&rsquo;t use that distressful word Radical), I wouldn&rsquo;t
      for the world have you act contrary to them. But I wouldn&rsquo;t have you
      obtrude them too ostentatiously&mdash;for your own sake, Le Breton, for
      your own sake, I assure you. Remember, you&rsquo;re a very young man yet:
      you have plenty of time before you to modify your opinions in: as you go
      on, you&rsquo;ll modify them&mdash;moderate them&mdash;bring them into
      harmony with the average opinions of ordinary parents. Don&rsquo;t commit
      yourself at present&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I would say to you&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      commit yourself at present. When you&rsquo;re as old as I am, my dear
      fellow, you&rsquo;ll see through all these youthful extravagances.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And as to the church, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; said Mrs. Greatrex, with
      bland suggestiveness from the ottoman, &lsquo;of course, we regard the
      present very unsatisfactory arrangement as only temporary. The doctor
      hopes in time to get a chapel built, which is much nicer for the boys, and
      also more convenient for the masters and their families&mdash;they all
      have seats, of course, in the chancel. At Charlton College, where the
      doctor was an assistant for some years, before we came to Pilbury, there
      was one of the under-masters, a young man of very good family, who took
      such an interest in the place that he not only contributed a hundred
      pounds out of his own pocket towards building a chapel, but also got ever
      so many of his wealthy friends elsewhere to subscribe, first to that, and
      then to the organ and stained-glass window. We&rsquo;ve got up a small
      building fund here ourselves already, of which the doctor&rsquo;s
      treasurer, and we hope before many years to have a really nice chapel,
      with good music and service well done&mdash;the kind of thing that&rsquo;ll
      be of use to the school, and have an excellent moral effect upon the boys
      in the way of religious training.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No doubt,&rsquo; Ernest answered evasively, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll soon
      manage to raise the money in such a place as Pilbury.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No doubt,&rsquo; the doctor replied, looking at him with a searching
      glance, and evidently harbouring an uncomfortable suspicion, already, that
      this young man had not got the moral and religious welfare of the boys
      quite so deeply at heart as was desirable in a model junior assistant
      master. &lsquo;Well, well, we shall see you at school to-morrow morning,
      Le Breton: till then I hope you&rsquo;ll find yourselves quite comfortable
      in your new lodgings.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest went back from this visit of ceremony with a doubtful heart, and
      left Dr. and Mrs. Greatrex alone to discuss their new acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Maria,&rsquo; said the doctor, in a dubious tone of voice, as soon
      as Ernest was fairly out of hearing, &lsquo;what do you think of him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Think!&rsquo; answered Mrs. Greatrex, energetically. &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t
      think at all. I feel sure he&rsquo;ll never, never, never make a
      schoolmaster!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rsquo; the doctor responded, pensively. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid not, Maria. He&rsquo;s got ideas of his own, I regret to say; and,
      what&rsquo;s worse, they&rsquo;re not the right ones.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, he&rsquo;ll never do,&rsquo; Mrs. Greatrex continued, scornfully.
      &lsquo;Nothing at all professional about him in any way. No interest or
      enthusiasm in the matter of the chapel; not a spark of responsiveness even
      about the stained-glass window; hardly a trace of moral or religious
      earnestness, of care for the welfare and happiness of the dear boys. He
      wouldn&rsquo;t in the least impress intending parents&mdash;or, rather, I
      feel sure he&rsquo;d impress them most unfavourably. The best thing we can
      do, now we&rsquo;ve got him, is to play off his name on relations in
      society, but to keep the young man himself as far as possible in the
      background. I confess he&rsquo;s a disappointment&mdash;a very great and
      distressing disappointment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He is, he is certainly,&rsquo; the doctor acquiesced, with a sigh of
      regretfulness. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we shall never be able to make much
      of him. But we must do our best&mdash;for his own sake, and the sake of
      the boys and parents, it&rsquo;s our duty, Maria, to do our best with him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, of course,&rsquo; Mrs. Greatrex replied, languidly: &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m
      bound to say, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll prove a very thankless piece of
      duty. Young men of his sort have never any proper sense of gratitude.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Edie, in the little lodgings in a side street near the
      school-house, had run out quickly to open the door for Ernest, and waited
      anxiously to hear his report upon their new employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Ernest dear,&rsquo; she asked, with something of the old childish
      brightness in her eager manner, &lsquo;and what do you think of them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, Edie,&rsquo; Ernest answered, kissing her white forehead gently, ‘I
      don&rsquo;t want to judge them too hastily, but I&rsquo;m inclined to
      fancy, on first sight, that both the doctor and his wife are most
      egregious and unmitigated humbugs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Humbugs, Ernest! why, how do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Edie, they&rsquo;ve got the moral and religious welfare of the boys
      at their very finger ends; and, do you know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to be
      uncharitable&mdash;but I somehow imagine they haven&rsquo;t got it at
      heart as well. However, we must do our best, and try to fall in with them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And for a whole year Ernest and Edie did try to fall in with them to the
      best of their ability. It was hard work, for though the doctor himself was
      really at bottom a kind-hearted man, with a mere thick veneer of
      professional humbug inseparable from his unhappy calling, Mrs. Greatrex
      was a veritable thorn in the flesh to poor little natural honest-hearted
      Edie. When she found that the Le Bretons didn&rsquo;t mean to take a house
      on the Parade or elsewhere, but were to live ingloriously in wee side
      street lodgings, her disappointment was severe and extreme; but when she
      incidentally discovered that Mrs. Le Breton was positively a grocer&rsquo;s
      daughter from a small country town, her moral indignation against the
      baseness of mankind rose almost to white heat. To think that young Le
      Breton should have insinuated himself into the position of third master
      under false pretences&mdash;should have held out as qualifications for the
      post his respectable connections, when he knew perfectly well all the time
      that he was going to marry somebody who was not in Society&mdash;it was
      really quite too awfully wicked and deceptive and unprincipled of him! A
      very bad, dishonest young man, she was very much afraid; a young man with
      no sense of truth or honour about him, though, of course, she wouldn&rsquo;t
      say so for the world before any of the parents, or do anything to injure
      the poor young fellow&rsquo;s future prospects if she could possibly help
      it. But Mrs. Greatrex felt sure that Ernest had come to Pilbury of malice
      prepense, as part of a deep-laid scheme to injure and ruin the doctor by
      his horrid revolutionary notions. &lsquo;He does it on purpose,&rsquo; she
      used to say; &lsquo;he talks in that way because he knows it positively
      shocks and annoys us. He pretends to be very innocent all the time; but at
      heart he&rsquo;s a malignant, jealous, uncharitable creature. I&rsquo;m
      sure I wish he had never come to Pilbury Regis! And to go quarrelling with
      his own mother, too&mdash;the unnatural man! The only respectable relation
      he had, and the only one at all likely to produce any good or salutary
      effect upon intending parents!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear,&rsquo; the doctor would answer apologetically, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
      really quite too hard upon young Le Breton. As far as school-work goes, he&rsquo;s
      a capital master, I assure you&mdash;so conscientious, and hard-working,
      and systematic. He does his very best with the boys, even with that stupid
      lout, Blenkinsopp major; and he has managed to din something into them in
      mathematics somehow, so that I&rsquo;m sure the fifth form will pass a
      better examination this term than any term since we first came here. Now
      that, you know, is really a great thing, even if he doesn&rsquo;t quite
      fall in with our preconceived social requirements.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know about the mathematics or the fifth
      form, Joseph,&rsquo; Mrs. Geatrex used to reply, with great dignity.
      &lsquo;That sort of thing falls under your department, I&rsquo;m aware,
      not under mine. But I&rsquo;m sure that for all social purposes, Mr. Le
      Breton is really a great deal worse than useless. A more unchristian,
      disagreeable, self-opinionated, wrong-headed, objectionable young man I
      never came across in the whole course of my experience. However, you
      wouldn&rsquo;t listen to my advice upon the subject, so it&rsquo;s no use
      talking any longer about it. I always advised you not to take him without
      further enquiry into his antecedents; and you overbore me: you said he was
      so well-connected, and so forth, and would hear nothing against him; so I
      wish you joy now of your precious bargain. The only thing left for us is
      to find some good opportunity of getting rid of him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I like the young man, as far as he goes,&rsquo; Dr. Greatrex replied
      once, with unwonted spirit, &lsquo;and I won&rsquo;t get rid of him at
      all, my dear, unless he obliges me to. He&rsquo;s really well meaning, in
      spite of all his absurdities, and upon my word, Maria, I believe he&rsquo;s
      thoroughly honest in his opinions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Greatrex only met this flat rebellion by an indirect remark to the
      effect that some people seemed absolutely destitute of the very faintest
      glimmering power of judging human character.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; LITERATURE, MUSIC, AND THE DRAMA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘The Primate of Fiji&rsquo; was duly accepted and put into rehearsal by
      the astute and enterprising manager of the Ambiguities Theatre. ‘It&rsquo;s
      a risk,&rsquo; he said candidly, when he read the manuscript over, ‘a
      decided risk, Mr. Berkeley; I acknowledge the riskiness, but I don&rsquo;t
      mind trying it for all that. You see, you&rsquo;ve staked everything upon
      the doubtful supposition that the Public possesses a certain amount of
      elementary intelligence, and a certain appreciation of genuine original
      wit and humour. Your play&rsquo;s literature, good literature; and that&rsquo;s
      rather a speculative element to introduce into the regular theatre
      nowadays. Illegitimate, I should call it; decidedly illegitimate&mdash;but
      still, perhaps, worth trying. Do you know the story about old Simon
      Burbury, the horsedealer? Young Simon says to him one morning, &ldquo;Father,
      don&rsquo;t you think we might manage to conduct this business of ours
      without always telling quite so many downright lies about it?&rdquo; The
      old man looks back at him reproachfully, and says with a solemn shake of
      the head, &ldquo;Ah, Simon, Simon, little did I ever think I should live
      to see a son of mine go in for speculation!&rdquo; Well, my dear sir, that&rsquo;s
      pretty much how a modern manager feels about the literary element in the
      drama. The Public isn&rsquo;t accustomed to it, and there&rsquo;s no
      knowing how they may take it. Shakespeare, now, they stand readily enough,
      because he&rsquo;s an old-established and perfectly respectable family
      purveyor. Sheridan, too, of course, and one play of Goldsmith&rsquo;s, and
      a trifle or so of George Colman&mdash;all recognised and all tolerated
      because of their old prescriptive respectability. But for a new author to
      aim at being literary&rsquo;s rather presumptuous; now tell me yourself,
      isn&rsquo;t it? Seems as if he was setting himself up for a heaven-sent
      genius, and trying to sit upon the older dramatists of the present
      generation. Melodrama, sensation, burlesque&mdash;that&rsquo;s all right
      enough&mdash;perfectly legitimate; but a real literary comic opera, with
      good words and good music&mdash;it IS a little strong, for a beginner, Mr.
      Berkeley, you WILL acknowledge.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But don&rsquo;t you think,&rsquo; Arthur answered, smiling
      good-humouredly at his cynical frankness, &lsquo;an educated and cultured
      Public is beginning to grow up that may, perhaps, really prefer a little
      literature, provided it&rsquo;s made light enough and attractive enough
      for their rapid digestion? Don&rsquo;t you think intelligent people are
      beginning to get just a trifle sick of burlesque, and spectacle, and
      sensation, and melodrama?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, my dear sir,&rsquo; the manager answered promptly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      the exact chance on which I&rsquo;m calculating when I venture to accept
      your comic opera from an unknown beginner. It&rsquo;s clever, there&rsquo;s
      no denying that, and I hope the fact won&rsquo;t be allowed to tell
      against it: but the music&rsquo;s bright and lively; the songs are quaint
      and catching; the dialogue&rsquo;s brisk and not too witty; and there&rsquo;s
      plenty of business&mdash;plenty of business in it. I incline to think we
      can get together a house at the Ambiguities that&rsquo;ll enter into the
      humour of the thing, and see what your play&rsquo;s driving at. How did
      you learn all about stage requirements, though? I never saw a beginner&rsquo;s
      play with so little in it that was absolutely impossible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was a Shooting Star at Oxford,&rsquo; Berkeley answered simply, ‘so
      that I know something&mdash;like a despised amateur&mdash;about stage
      necessities; and I&rsquo;ve written one or two little pieces before for
      private acting. Besides, Watkiss has helped me with all the technical
      arrangements of the little opera.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; the manager answered, more confidently; &lsquo;I
      won&rsquo;t predict a success, because you know a manager should never
      prophesy unless he knows; but I think there&rsquo;s a Public in London
      that&rsquo;ll take it in, just as they took in &ldquo;Caste&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; twenty years back, at the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s.
      Anyhow, I&rsquo;m quite prepared to give it a fair trial.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first night, Arthur Berkeley and the Progenitor went down in fear
      and trembling to the stage door of the Ambiguities. There was a full
      house, and the critics were all present, in some surprise at the temerity
      of this new man; for it was noised abroad already by those who had seen
      the rehearsals that &lsquo;The Primate of Fiji&rsquo; was a fresh
      departure, after its own fashion, in the matter of English comic opera.
      The curtain rose upon the chorus of mermaids, and the first song was a
      decided hit. Still the Public, as becomes a first night, maintained a
      dignified and critical reserve. When the President of the Board of Trade,
      in full court costume, appeared upon the scene, in the midst of the very
      realistic long-haired sea-ladies, the audience was half shocked for a
      moment by the utter incongruity of the situation; but after a while they
      began to discover that the incongruity was part of the joke, and they
      laughed quietly a sedate and moderate laugh of suspended judgment. As the
      Progenitor had predicted, the gods were the first to enter into the spirit
      of the fun, and to give a hand to the Primate&rsquo;s first sermon. The
      scientific professors on the Challenger Expedition took the fancy of the
      house a little more decidedly; and even the stalls thawed visibly when the
      professor of biology delivered his famous exposition of the evolution
      hypothesis to the assembled chiefs of Raratouga. But it was the one feeble
      second-hand old joke of the piece that really brought pit and boxes down
      together in a sudden fit of inextinguishable laughter. The professor of
      political economy enquired diligently, with note book in hand, of the
      Princess of Fiji, whether she thought the influence of the missionaries
      beneficial or otherwise; whether she considered these preachers of a new
      religion really good or not; to which the unsophisticated child of nature
      responded naively, &lsquo;Good, very good&mdash;roasted; but not quite so
      good boiled,&rsquo; and the professor gravely entered the answer in his
      philosophic note-book. It was a very ancient jest indeed, but it tickled
      the ribs of the house mightily, as ancient jests usually do, and they
      burst forthwith into a hearty roar of genuine approval. Then Arthur began
      to breathe more freely. After that the house toned down again quietly, and
      gave no decided token of approbation till the end of the piece. When the
      curtain dropped there was a lull of hushed expectation for poor Arthur
      Berkeley; and at its close the house broke out into a storm of applause,
      and ‘The Primate of Fiji&rsquo; had firmly secured its position as the one
      great theatrical success of the present generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud cry of &lsquo;Author! Author!&rsquo; and Arthur Berkeley,
      hardly knowing how he got there, or what he was standing on, found himself
      pushed from behind by friendly hands, on to the narrow space between the
      curtain and the footlights. He became aware that a very hot and red body,
      presumably himself, was bowing mechanically to a seething and clapping
      mass of hands and faces over the whole theatre. Backing out again, in the
      same semi-conscious fashion, with the universe generally reeling on more
      than one distinct axis all around him, he was seized and hand-shaken
      violently, first by the Progenitor, then by the manager, and then by half
      a dozen other miscellaneous and unknown persons. At last, after a lot more
      revolutions of the universe, he found himself comfortably pitched into a
      convenient hansom, with the Progenitor by his side; and hardly knew
      anything further till he discovered his own quiet supper table at the
      Chelsea lodgings, and saw his father mixing a strong glass of brandy and
      seltzer for him, to counteract the strength of the excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Arthur Berkeley &lsquo;awoke, and found himself famous.&rsquo;
      ‘The Primate of Fiji&rsquo; was the rage of the moment. Everybody went to
      hear it&mdash;everybody played its tunes at their own pianos&mdash;everybody
      quoted it, and adapted it, and used its clever catchwords as the pet
      fashionable slang expressions of the next three seasons. Arthur Berkeley
      was the lion of the hour; and the mantelpiece of the quiet little Chelsea
      study was ranged three rows deep with cards of invitation from people
      whose very names Arthur had never heard of six months before, and whom the
      Progenitor declared it was a sin and shame for any respectable young man
      of sound economical education even to countenance. There were countesses,
      and marchionesses, too, among the senders of those coronetted
      parallelograms of waste pasteboard, as the Progenitor called them&mdash;nay,
      there was even one invitation on the mantelpiece that bore the three
      strawberry leaves and other insignia of Her Grace the Duchess of
      Leicestershire.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can&rsquo;t you give us just ONE evening, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; said Lady
      Hilda Tregellis, as she sat on the centre ottoman in Mrs. Campbell
      Moncrieff&rsquo;s drawing-room with Arthur Berkeley talking lightly to her
      about the nothings which constitute polite conversation in the nineteenth
      century. &lsquo;Just one evening, any day after the next fortnight? We
      should be so delighted if you could manage to favour us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t, Lady Hilda,&rsquo; Arthur answered.
      &lsquo;My evenings are so dreadfully full just now; and besides, you know,
      I&rsquo;m not accustomed to so much society, and it unsettles me for my
      daily work. After all, you see, I&rsquo;m a journeyman playwright now, and
      I have to labour at my unholy calling just like the theatrical carpenter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How delightfully frank,&rsquo; thought Lady Hilda. &lsquo;Really I like
      him quite immensely.&mdash;Not even the afternoon on Wednesday fortnight?&rsquo;
      she went on aloud. &lsquo;You might come to our garden party on Wednesday
      fortnight.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite impossible,&rsquo; Arthur Berkeley answered. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my
      regular day at Pilbury Regis.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pilbury Regis!&rsquo; cried Lady Hilda, starting a little. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
      mean to say you have engagements, and in the thick of the season, too, at
      Pilbury Regis!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I have, every Wednesday fortnight,&rsquo; Berkeley answered, with a
      smile. &lsquo;I go there regularly. You see, Lady Hilda, Wednesday&rsquo;s
      a half-holiday at Pilbury Grammar School; so every second week I run down
      for the day to visit an old friend of mine, who&rsquo;s also an
      acquaintance of yours, I believe,&mdash;Ernest Le Breton. He&rsquo;s
      married now, you know, and has got a mastership at the Pilbury Grammar
      School.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you know Mr. Le Breton!&rsquo; cried Lady Hilda, charmed at this
      rapprochement of two delightfully original men. &lsquo;He is so nice. I
      like him immensely, and I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re a friend of his.
      And Mrs. Le Breton, too; wasn&rsquo;t it nice of him? Tell me, Mr.
      Berkeley, was she really and truly a grocer&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Berkeley&rsquo;s voice grew a little stiffer and colder as he answered,
      ‘She was a sister of Oswald of Oriel, the great mathematician, who was
      killed last year by falling from the summit of a peak in the Bernina.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, yes, yes, I know all about that, of course,&rsquo; said Lady Hilda,
      quickly and carelessly. &lsquo;I know her brother was very clever and all
      that sort of thing; but then there are so many men who are very clever,
      aren&rsquo;t there? The really original thing about it all, you know, was
      that he actually married a grocer&rsquo;s daughter. That was really quite
      too delightfully original. I was charmed when I heard about it: I thought
      it was so exactly like dear Mr. Le Breton. He&rsquo;s so deliciously
      unconventional in every way. He was Lynmouth&rsquo;s tutor for a while, as
      you&rsquo;ve heard, of course; and then he went away from us, at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice, so nicely, because he wouldn&rsquo;t stand papa&rsquo;s abominable
      behaviour, and quite right, too, when it was a matter of conscience&mdash;I
      dare say he&rsquo;s told you all about it, that horrid pigeon-shooting
      business. Well, and so you know Mrs. Le Breton&mdash;do tell me, what sort
      of person is she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She&rsquo;s very nice, and very good, and very pretty, and very clever,&rsquo;
      Arthur answered, a little constrainedly. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I
      can tell you anything more about her than that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you really like her?&rsquo; said Lady Hilda, warmly. &lsquo;You
      think her a fit wife for Mr. Le Breton, do you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think him a very lucky fellow indeed to have married such a charming
      and beautiful woman,&rsquo; Arthur answered, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda noticed his manner, and read through it at once with a woman&rsquo;s
      quickness. &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; she said to herself: &lsquo;the wind blows
      that way, does it? What a very remarkable girl she must be, really, to
      have attracted two such men as Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Le Breton. I&rsquo;ve
      lost one of them to her; I can&rsquo;t very well lose the other, too: for
      after Ernest Le Breton, I&rsquo;ve never seen any man I should care to
      marry so much as Mr. Arthur Berkeley.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lady Hilda,&rsquo; said the hostess, coming up to her at that moment,
      ‘you&rsquo;ll play us something, won&rsquo;t you? You know you promised to
      bring your music.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda rose at once with stately alacrity. Nothing could have pleased her
      better. She went to the piano, and, to the awe and astonishment of Mrs.
      Campbell Moncrieff, took out an arrangement of the Fijian war-dance from
      &lsquo;The Primate of Fiji.&rsquo; It suited her brilliant slap-dash style
      of execution admirably; and she felt she had never played so well in her
      life before. The presence of the composer, which would have frightened and
      unnerved most girls of her age, only made Hilda Tregellis the bolder and
      the more ambitious. Here was somebody at least who knew something about
      it; none of your ordinary fashionable amateurs and mere soulless
      professional performers, but the very man who had made the music&mdash;the
      man in whose brain the notes had first gathered themselves together into
      speaking melody, and who could really judge the comparative merits of her
      rapid execution. She played with wonderful verve and spirit, so that Lady
      Exmoor, seated on the side sofa opposite, though shocked at first at Hilda&rsquo;s
      choice of a piece, glanced more than once at the wealthiest young commoner
      present (she had long since mentally resigned herself to the prospect of a
      commoner for that poor dear foolish Hilda), and closely watched his face
      to see what effect this unwonted outburst of musical talent might succeed
      in producing upon his latent susceptibilities. But Lady Hilda herself wasn&rsquo;t
      thinking of the wealthy commoner; she was playing straight at Arthur
      Berkeley: and when she saw that Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s mouth had melted
      slowly into an approving smile, she played even more brilliantly and
      better than ever, after her bold, smart, vehement fashion. As she left the
      piano, Arthur said, &lsquo;Thank you; I have never heard the piece better
      rendered.&rsquo; And Lady Hilda felt that that was a triumph which far
      outweighed any number of inane compliments from a whole regiment of
      simpering Algies, Monties, and Berties.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You can&rsquo;t say any evening, then, Mr. Berkeley?&rsquo; she said once
      more, as she held out her hand to him to say &lsquo;Good-night&rsquo; a
      little later: &lsquo;not any evening at all, or part of an evening? You
      might really reconsider your engagements.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur hesitated visibly. &lsquo;Well, possibly I might manage it,&rsquo;
      he said, wavering, &lsquo;though, I assure you, my evenings are very much
      more than full already.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then don&rsquo;t make it an evening,&rsquo; said Lady Hilda, pressingly.
      ‘Make it lunch. After all, Mr. Berkeley, it&rsquo;s we ourselves who want
      to see you; not to show you off as a curiosity to all the rest of London.
      We have silly people enough in the evenings; but if you&rsquo;ll come to
      lunch with us alone one day, we shall have an opportunity of talking to
      you on our own account.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda was tall and beautiful, and Lady Hilda spoke, as she always
      used to speak, with manifest sincerity. Now, it is not in human nature not
      to feel flattered when a beautiful woman pays one genuine homage; and
      Arthur Berkeley was quite as human, after all, as most other people.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,&rsquo; he said, smiling. ‘I must make it
      lunch, then, though I really ought to be working in the mornings instead
      of running about merely to amuse myself. What day will suit you best?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, not to amuse yourself, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; Hilda answered pointedly,
      ‘but to gratify us. That, you know, is a work of benevolence. Say Monday
      next, then, at two o&rsquo;clock. Will that do for you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perfectly,&rsquo; Berkeley answered, taking her proffered hand extended
      to him with just that indefinable air of frankness which Lady Hilda knew
      so well how to throw into all her actions. &lsquo;Good evening. Wilton
      Place, isn&rsquo;t it!&mdash;Gracious heavens!&rsquo; he thought to
      himself, as he glanced after her satin train sweeping slowly down the
      grand staircase, &lsquo;what on earth would the dear old Progenitor say if
      only he saw me in the midst of these meaningless aristocratic orgies. I am
      positively half-wheedled, it seems, into making love to an earl&rsquo;s
      daughter! If this sort of thing continues, I shall find myself, before I
      know it, connected by marriage with two-thirds of the British peerage. A
      beautiful woman, really, and quite queen-like in her manner when she doesn&rsquo;t
      choose rather to be unaffectedly gracious. How she sat upon that tall
      young man with the brown moustaches over by the mantelpiece! I didn&rsquo;t
      hear what she said to him, but I could see he was utterly crushed by the
      way he slank away with his tail between his legs, like a whipped spaniel.
      A splendid woman&mdash;and no doubt about it; looks as if she&rsquo;d
      stepped straight out of the canvas of Titian, with the pearls in her hair
      and everything else exactly as he painted them. The handsomest girl I ever
      saw in my life&mdash;but not like Edie Le Breton. They say a man can only
      fall in love once in a lifetime. I wonder whether there&rsquo;s any truth
      in it! Well, well, you won&rsquo;t often see a finer woman in her own
      style than Lady Hilda Tregellis. Monday next, at two precisely; I needn&rsquo;t
      make a note of it&mdash;no fear of my forgetting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I really do think,&rsquo; Lady Hilda said to herself as she unrolled the
      pearls from her thick hair in her own room that winter evening, ‘I almost
      like him better than I did Ernest Le Breton. The very first night I saw
      him at Lady Mary&rsquo;s I fell quite in love with his appearance, before
      I knew even who he was; and now that I&rsquo;ve found out all about him, I
      never did hear anything so absolutely and delightfully original. His
      father a common shoemaker! That, to begin with, throws Ernest Le Breton
      quite into the shade! HIS father was a general in the Indian army&mdash;nothing
      could be more BANAL. Then Mr. Berkeley began life as a clergyman; but now
      he&rsquo;s taken off his white choker, and wears a suit of grey tweed like
      any ordinary English gentleman. So delightfully unconventional, isn&rsquo;t
      it? At last, to crown it all, he not only composes delicious music, but
      goes and writes a comic opera&mdash;such a comic opera! And the best of it
      is, success hasn&rsquo;t turned his head one atom. He doesn&rsquo;t run
      with vulgar eagerness after the great people, like your ordinary everyday
      successful nobody. He took no more notice of me, myself, at first, because
      I was Lady Hilda Tregellis, than if I&rsquo;d been a common milkmaid; and
      he wouldn&rsquo;t come to our garden party because he wanted to go down to
      Pilbury Regis to visit the Le Bretons at their charity school or
      something! It was only after I played the war-dance arrangement so well&mdash;I
      never played so brilliantly in my life before&mdash;that he began to alter
      and soften a little. Certainly, these pearls do thoroughly become me. I
      think he looked after me when I was leaving the room just a tiny bit, as
      if he was really pleased with me for my own sake, and not merely because I
      happen to be called Lady Hilda Tregellis.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s really very annoying, this letter from Selah,&rsquo; Herbert
      Le Breton murmured to himself, as he carefully burnt the compromising
      document, envelope and all, with a fusee from his oriental silver pocket
      match-case. &lsquo;I had hoped the thing had all been forgotten by this
      time, after her long silence, and my last two judiciously chilly letters&mdash;a
      sort of slow refrigerating process for poor shivering naked little Cupid.
      But here, just at the very moment when I fancied the affair had quite
      blown over, comes this most objectionable letter, telling me that Selah
      has actually betaken herself to London to meet me; and what makes it more
      annoying still, I wanted to go up myself this week to dine at home with
      Ethel Faucit. Mother&rsquo;s plan about Ethel Faucit is exceedingly
      commendable; a girl with eight hundred a year, cultivated tastes, and no
      father or other encumbrances dragging after her. I always said I should
      like to marry a poor orphan. A very desirable young woman to annex in
      every way! And now, here&rsquo;s Selah Briggs&mdash;ugh! how could I ever
      have gone and entangled myself in my foolish days with a young woman
      burdened by such a cognomen!&mdash;here&rsquo;s Selah Briggs must needs
      run away from Hastings, and try to hunt me up on her own account in
      London. If I dared, I wouldn&rsquo;t go up to see her at all, and would
      let the thing die a natural death of inanition&mdash;sine Cerere et
      Baccho, and so forth&mdash;(I&rsquo;m afraid, poor girl, she&rsquo;ll be
      more likely to find Bacchus than Ceres if she sticks in London); but the
      plain fact is, I don&rsquo;t dare&mdash;that&rsquo;s the long and the
      short of it. If I did, Selah&rsquo;d be tracking me to earth here in
      Oxford, and a nice mess that&rsquo;d make of it! She doesn&rsquo;t know my
      name, to be sure; but as soon as she called at college and found nobody of
      the name of Walters was known there, she&rsquo;d lie in wait for me about
      the gates, as sure as my name&rsquo;s Herbert Le Breton, and sooner or
      later she&rsquo;d take it out of me, one way or the other. Selah has as
      many devils in her as the Gergesene who dwelt among the tombs, I&rsquo;ll
      be sworn to it; and if she&rsquo;s provoked, she&rsquo;ll let them all
      loose in a legion to crush me. I&rsquo;d better see her and have it out
      quietly, once for all, than try to shirk it here in Oxford and let myself
      in at the end for the worse condemnation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this impression, Herbert Le Breton, leaning back in his well-padded
      oak armchair, ordered his scout to pack his portmanteau, and set off by
      the very first fast train for Paddington station. He would get over his
      interview with Selah Briggs in the afternoon, and return to Epsilon
      Terrace in good time for Lady Le Breton&rsquo;s dinner. Say what you like
      of it, Ethel Faucit and eight hundred a year, certe redditum, was a thing
      in no wise to be sneezed at by a judicious and discriminating person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert left his portmanteau in the cloakroom at Paddington, and drove off
      in a hansom to the queer address which Selah had given him. It was a fishy
      lodging of the commoner sort in a back street at Notting Hill, not far
      from the Portobello Road. At the top of the stairs, Selah stood waiting to
      meet him, and seemed much astonished when, instead of kissing her, as was
      his wont, he only shook her hand somewhat coolly. But she thought to
      herself that probably he didn&rsquo;t wish to be too demonstrative before
      the eyes of the lodging-house people, and so took no further notice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Selah,&rsquo; Herbert said, as soon as he entered the room, and
      seated himself quietly on one of the straight-backed wooden chairs, ‘why
      on earth have you come to London?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Goodness gracious, Herbert,&rsquo; Selah answered, letting loose the
      floodgates of her rapid speech after a week&rsquo;s silence, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      you go and ask me why I&rsquo;ve done it. Ask me rather why I didn&rsquo;t
      go and do it long ago. Father, he&rsquo;s got more and more aggravating
      every day for the last twelve-month, till at last I couldn&rsquo;t stand
      him any longer. Prayer meetings, missionary meetings, convention meetings,
      all that sort of thing I could put up with somehow; but when it came to
      private exhortations and prayer over me with three or four of the godliest
      neighbours, I made up my mind not to put up with it one day longer. So
      last week I packed up two or three little things hurriedly, and left a
      note behind to say I felt I was too unregenerate to live in such spiritual
      company any longer; and came straight up here to London, and took these
      lodgings. Emily Lucas, she wrote to me from Hastings&mdash;she&rsquo;s the
      daughter of the hairdresser in our street, you know, and I told her to
      write to me to the Post-office. Emily Lucas wrote to me that there was
      weeping and gnashing of teeth, and swearing almost, when they found out I&rsquo;d
      really left them. And well there might be, indeed, for I did more work for
      them (mostly just to get away for a while from the privileges) than they&rsquo;ll
      ever get a hired servant to do for them in this world, Herbert.&rsquo;
      Herbert moved uneasily on his chair, as he noticed how glibly she called
      him now by his Christian name instead of saying &lsquo;Mr. Walters.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;And Emily says,&rsquo; Selah went on, without stopping to take
      breath for a second, &lsquo;that father put an advertisement at once into
      the &ldquo;Christian Mirror&rdquo;&mdash;pah, as if it was likely I should
      go buying or reading the &ldquo;Christian Mirror,&rdquo; indeed&mdash;to
      say that if &ldquo;S. B.&rdquo; would return at once to her affectionate
      and injured parents, the whole past would be forgotten and forgiven.
      Forgotten and forgiven! I should think it would, indeed! But he didn&rsquo;t
      ask me whether their eternal bothering and plaguing of me about my
      precious soul for twenty years past would also be forgotten and forgiven!
      He didn&rsquo;t ask me whether all their meetings, and conventions, and
      prayers, and all the rest of it, would be forgotten and forgiven! My
      precious soul! In Turkey they say the women have no souls! I often wished
      it had been my happy lot to be born in Turkey, and then, perhaps, they
      wouldn&rsquo;t have worried me so much about it. I&rsquo;m sure I often
      said to them, &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t bother on account of my poor
      unfortunate misguided little soul any longer. It&rsquo;s lost altogether,
      I don&rsquo;t doubt, and it doesn&rsquo;t in the least trouble me. If it
      was somebody else&rsquo;s, I could understand your being in such a fearful
      state of mind about it; but as it&rsquo;s only mine, you know, I&rsquo;m
      sure it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; And then they&rsquo;d only go
      off worse than ever,&mdash;mother doing hysterics, and so forth&mdash;and
      say I was a wicked, bad, abominable scoffer, and that it made them
      horribly frightened even to listen to me. As if I wasn&rsquo;t more likely
      to know the real value of my own soul than anybody else was!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked at her curiously and anxiously as she delivered this long
      harangue in a voluble stream, without a single pause or break; and then he
      said, in his quiet voice, &lsquo;How old are you, Selah?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Twenty-two,&rsquo; Selah answered, carelessly. &lsquo;Why, Herbert?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, nothing,&rsquo; Herbert replied, turning away his eyes from her keen,
      searching gaze uncomfortably. He congratulated himself inwardly on the
      lucky fact that she was fully of age, for then at least he could only get
      into a row with her, and not with her parents. &lsquo;And now, Selah, do
      you know what I strongly advise you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To get married at once,&rsquo; Selah put in promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert drew himself up stiffly, and looked at her cautiously out of the
      corner of his eyes. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said slowly, &lsquo;not to get
      married, but to go back again for the present to your people at Hastings.
      Consider, Selah, you&rsquo;ve done a very foolish thing indeed by coming
      here alone in this way. You&rsquo;ve compromised yourself, and you&rsquo;ve
      compromised me. Indeed, if it weren&rsquo;t for the lasting affection I
      bear you&rsquo;&mdash;he put this in awkwardly, but he felt it necessary
      to do so, for the flash of Selah&rsquo;s eyes fairly cowed him for the
      moment&mdash;&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have come here at all this afternoon
      to see you. It might get us both into very serious trouble, and&mdash;and&mdash;and
      delay the prospect of our marriage. You see, everything depends upon my
      keeping my fellowship until I can get an appointment to marry on. Anything
      that risks loss of the fellowship is really a measurable danger for both
      of us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah looked at him very steadily with her big eyes, and Herbert felt that
      he was quailing a little under their piercing, withering inquisition. By
      Jove, what a splendid woman she was, though, when she was angry! &lsquo;Herbert,&rsquo;
      she said, rising from her chair and standing her full height imperiously
      before him, &lsquo;Herbert, you&rsquo;re deceiving me. I almost believe
      you&rsquo;re shilly-shallying with me. I almost believe you don&rsquo;t
      ever really mean to marry me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert moved uneasily upon his wooden seat. What was he to do? Should he
      make a clean breast of it forthwith, and answer boldly, ‘Well, Selah, you
      have exactly diagnosed my mental attitude&rsquo;? Or should he try to put
      her off a little with some meaningless explanatory platitudes? Or should
      he&mdash;by Jove, she was a very splendid woman!&mdash;should he take her
      in his arms that moment, kiss her doubts and fears away like a donkey, and
      boldly and sincerely promise to marry her? Pooh! not such a fool as all
      that comes to! not even with Selah before him now; for he was no boy any
      longer, and not to be caught by the mere vulgar charms of a flashy,
      self-asserting greengrocer&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Selah,&rsquo; he said at last, after a long pause, &lsquo;I strongly
      advise you once more to return to Hastings for the present. You&rsquo;ll
      find it better for you in the end. If your people are quite unendurable&mdash;as
      I don&rsquo;t doubt they are from what you tell me&mdash;you could look
      about meanwhile for a temporary appointment, say as&rsquo;&mdash;he
      checked himself from uttering the word &lsquo;shop girl,&rsquo; and
      substituted for it, &lsquo;draper&rsquo;s assistant.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah looked at him angrily. &lsquo;What fools you men are about such
      things!&rsquo; she said in a voice of utter scorn. &lsquo;When do you
      suppose I ever learnt the drapery? Or who do you suppose would ever give
      me a place in a shop of that sort without having learnt the drapery? I
      dare say you think it takes ten years to make one of you fine gentlemen at
      college, with your Greek and your Latin, but that the drapery, or the
      millinery, or the confectionery, comes by nature! However, that&rsquo;s
      not the question now. The question&rsquo;s simply this&mdash;Herbert
      Walters, do you or don&rsquo;t you mean to marry me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I must temporise,&rsquo; Herbert thought to himself, placidly. &lsquo;This
      girl&rsquo;s quite too unreservedly categorical! She eliminates modality
      with a vengeance!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, Selah,&rsquo; he said in his calmest
      and most deliberate manner, &lsquo;we must take a great many points into
      consideration before deciding on that matter.&rsquo; And then he went on
      to tell her what seemed to him the pros and cons of an immediate marriage.
      Couldn&rsquo;t she get a place meanwhile of some sort? Couldn&rsquo;t she
      let him have time to look about him? Couldn&rsquo;t she go back just for a
      few days to Hastings, until he could hear of something feasible for either
      of them? Selah interrupted him more than once with forcible interjectional
      observations such as &lsquo;bosh!&rsquo; and &lsquo;rubbish!&rsquo; and
      when he had finished she burst out once more into a long and voluble
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than an hour Herbert Le Breton and Selah Briggs fenced with one
      another, each after their own fashion, in the little fishy lodgings; and
      at every fresh thrust, Herbert parried so much the worse that at last
      Selah lost patience utterly, and rose in the end to the dignity of the
      situation. &lsquo;Herbert Walters,&rsquo; she said, looking at him with
      unspeakable contempt, &lsquo;I see through your flimsy excuses now, and I
      feel certain you don&rsquo;t mean to marry me! You never did mean to marry
      me! You wanted to amuse yourself by making love to a poor girl in a
      country town, and now you&rsquo;d like to throw her overboard and leave
      her alone to her own devices. I knew you meant that when you didn&rsquo;t
      write to me; but I wouldn&rsquo;t condemn you unheard; I gave you a chance
      to clear yourself. I see now you were trying to drop the acquaintance
      quietly, and make it seem as if I had backed out of it as well as you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert felt the moment for breaking through all reserve had finally
      arrived. &lsquo;You admirably interpret my motives in the matter, Selah,&rsquo;
      he said coldly. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be just of me to
      interfere with your prospects in life any longer. I can&rsquo;t say how
      long it may be before I am able to afford marriage; and, meanwhile, I&rsquo;m
      preventing you from forming a natural alliance with some respectable and
      estimable young man in your own station. I should be sorry to stand in
      your way any further; but if I could offer you any small pecuniary
      assistance at any time, either now or hereafter, you know I&rsquo;d be
      very happy indeed to do so, Selah.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The angry girl turned upon him fiercely. &lsquo;Selah!&rsquo; she cried in
      a tone of crushing contempt. &lsquo;What do you mean by calling me Selah,
      sir? How dare you speak to me by my Christian name in the same breath you
      tell me you don&rsquo;t mean to marry me? How dare you have the insolence
      and impertinence to offer me money! Never say another word to me as long
      as you live, Herbert Walters; and leave me now, for I don&rsquo;t want to
      have anything more to say to you or your money for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert took up his hat doubtfully. &lsquo;Selah!&mdash;Selah!&mdash;Miss
      Briggs, I mean,&rsquo; he said, falteringly, for at that moment Selah&rsquo;s
      face was terrible to look at. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, I can assure
      you, that this interview&mdash;and our pleasant acquaintance&mdash;should
      unfortunately have had such a disagreeable termination. For my own part&rsquo;&mdash;Herbert
      was always politic&mdash;&lsquo;I should have wished to part with you in
      no unfriendly spirit. I should have wished to learn your plans for the
      future, and to aid you in forming a suitable settlement in life hereafter.
      May I venture to ask, before I go, whether you mean to remain in London or
      to return to Hastings? As one who has been your sincere friend, I should
      at least like to know what are your movements for the immediate present.
      How long do you mean to stop here, and when you leave these rooms where do
      you think you will next go to?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Confoundedly awkward,&rsquo;
      he thought to himself, &lsquo;to have her prowling about and dogging one&rsquo;s
      footsteps here in London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah read through his miserable transparent little pretences at once with
      a woman&rsquo;s quick instinctive insight. &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; she cried,
      pushing him away from her, figuratively, with a gesture of disgust, ‘do
      you think, you poor suspicious creature, I want to go spying you or
      following you all over London? Are you afraid, in your sordid little
      respectable way, that I&rsquo;ll come up to Oxford to pry and peep into
      that snug comfortable fellowship of yours? Do you suppose I&rsquo;m so
      much in love with you, Herbert Walters, that I can&rsquo;t let you go
      without wanting to fawn upon you and run after you ever afterwards! Pah!
      you miserable, pitiable, contemptible cur and coward, are you afraid even
      of a woman! Go away, and don&rsquo;t be frightened. I never want to see
      you or speak to you again as long as I live, you wretched, lying,
      shuffling hypocrite. I&rsquo;d rather go back to my own people at Hastings
      a thousand times over than have anything more to do with you. They may be
      narrow-minded, and bigoted, and ignorant, and stupid, but at least they&rsquo;re
      honest&mdash;they&rsquo;re not liars and hypocrites. Go this minute,
      Herbert Walters, go away this minute, and don&rsquo;t stand there fiddling
      and quivering with your hat like a whipped schoolboy, but go at once, and
      take my eternal loathing and contempt for a parting present with you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert held the door gingerly ajar for half a second, trying to think of
      a neat and appropriate epigram, but at that particular moment, for the
      life of him, he couldn&rsquo;t hit on one. So he closed the door after him
      quietly, and walking out alone into the street, immediately nailed a
      passing hansom. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t come out of that dilemma very
      creditably to myself, I must admit,&rsquo; he thought with a burning face,
      as he rolled along quickly in the hansom; &lsquo;but anyhow, now I&rsquo;m
      well out of it. The coast&rsquo;s all clear at last for Ethel Faucit. It&rsquo;s
      well to be off with the old love before you&rsquo;re on with the new, as
      that horrid vulgar practical proverb justly though somewhat coarsely puts
      it. Still, she&rsquo;s a perfectly magnificent creature, is Selah; and by
      Jove, when she got into that towering rage (and no wonder, for I won&rsquo;t
      be unjust to her in that respect), her tone and attitude would have done
      credit to any theatre. I should think Mrs. Siddons must have looked like
      that, say as Constance. Poor girl, I&rsquo;m really sorry for her; from
      the very bottom of my heart, I&rsquo;m really sorry for her. If it rested
      with me alone, hang me if I don&rsquo;t think I would positively have
      married her. But after all, the environment, you know, the environment is
      always too strong for us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the shabby lodgings near the Portobello Road, poor Selah,
      the excitement once over, was lying with her proud face buried in the
      pillows, and crying her very life out in great sobs of utter misery. The
      daydream of her whole existence was gone for ever: the bubble was burst;
      and nothing stood before her but a future of utter drudgery. &lsquo;The
      brute, the cur, the mean wretch,&rsquo; she said aloud between her sobs;
      &lsquo;and yet I loved him. How beautifully he talked, and how he made me
      love him. If it had only been a common everyday Methodist sweetheart, now!
      but Herbert Walters! Oh, God, how I hate him, and how I did love him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Herbert reached his mother&rsquo;s house in Epsilon Terrace, Lady Le
      Breton met him anxiously at the door. &lsquo;Herbert,&rsquo; she said,
      almost weeping, &lsquo;my dear boy, what on earth should I do if it were
      not for you! You&rsquo;re the one comfort I have in all my children. Would
      you believe it&mdash;no, you won&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;as I was walking
      back here this afternoon with Mrs. Faucit (Ethel&rsquo;s aunt, of all
      people in the world), what do you think I saw, in our own main street,
      too, but a young man, decently dressed, in his shirt sleeves. No coat, I
      assure you, but only his shirt sleeves. Imagine my horror when he came up
      to us&mdash;Mrs. Faucit, too, you know&mdash;and said to me out loud, in
      the most unconcerned voice, &ldquo;Well, mother!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t
      believe my eyes. Herbert, but I solemnly declare to you it was positively
      Ronald! You really could have knocked me down with a feather. Disgraceful,
      wasn&rsquo;t it, perfectly disgraceful!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How on earth did he come so?&rsquo; asked Herbert, almost smiling in
      spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, do you know, Herbert,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton answered somewhat
      obliquely, &lsquo;a few days since, I met him wheeling along a barrow full
      of coals for a dirty, grimy, ragged little girl from some alley or gutter
      somewhere. I believe they call the place the Mews&mdash;at the back of the
      terrace, you remember. He pretended the child wasn&rsquo;t big enough to
      wheel the coals, which was absurd, of course, or else her parents wouldn&rsquo;t
      have sent her; but I&rsquo;m sure he really did it on purpose to annoy me.
      He never does these things when I&rsquo;m not by to see; or if he does, I
      never see him. Now, that was bad enough in all conscience, wasn&rsquo;t
      it? but to-day what he did was still more outrageous. He met a poor man,
      as he calls him, in Westbourne Grove, who was one of his Christian
      brethren (is that the right expression?) and who declared he was next door
      to starving. So what must Ronald do, but run into a pawnbroker&rsquo;s&mdash;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have thought he could ever have heard of such a place&mdash;and
      sell his coat, or something of the sort, and give the man (who was
      doubtless an impostor) all the money. Then he positively walked home in
      his shirt sleeves. I call it a most unchristian thing to do&mdash;and to
      walk straight into my very arms, too, as I was coming along with Mrs.
      Faucit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert offered at once such condolences as were in his power. &lsquo;And
      are the Faucits coming to night?&rsquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Le Breton kissed him again gently on the forehead. &lsquo;Oh,
      Herbert,&rsquo; she said warmly, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what a
      comfort you always are to me. Oh yes, the Faucits are coming; and do you
      know, Herbert, my dear boy, I&rsquo;m quite sure that old Mr. Faucit, the
      uncle, wouldn&rsquo;t at all object to the match, and that Ethel&rsquo;s
      really very much disposed indeed to like you immensely. You&rsquo;ve only
      to follow up the advantage, my dear boy, and I don&rsquo;t for a moment
      think she&rsquo;d ever refuse you. And I&rsquo;ve been talking to Sir
      Sydney Weatherhead about your future, too, and he tells me (quite
      privately, of course) that, with your position and honours at Oxford, he
      fully believes he can easily push you into the first good vacant post at
      the Education Office; only you must be careful to say nothing about it
      beforehand, or the others will say it&rsquo;s a job, as they call it. Oh,
      Herbert, I really and truly can&rsquo;t tell you what a joy and a comfort
      you always are to me!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; THE PHILISTINES TRIUMPH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘My dear,&rsquo; said Dr. Greatrex, looking up in alarm from the lunch
      table one morning, in the third term of Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s stay at
      Pilbury, &lsquo;what an awful apparition! Do you know, I positively see
      Mr. Blenkinsopp, father of that odious boy Blenkinsopp major, distinctly
      visible to the naked eye, walking across the front lawn&mdash;on the grass
      too&mdash;to our doorway. The pupil&rsquo;s parent is really the very
      greatest bane of all the banes that beset a poor harassed overdriven
      schoolmaster&rsquo;s unfortunate existence!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Blenkinsopp?&rsquo; Mrs. Greatrex said reflectively. &lsquo;Blenkinsopp?
      Who is he? Oh, I remember, a tobacco-pipe manufacturer somewhere in the
      midland counties, isn&rsquo;t he? Mr. Blenkinsopp, of Staffordshire, I
      always say to other parents&mdash;not Brosely&mdash;Brosely sounds
      decidedly commercial and unpresentable. No nice people would naturally
      like their sons to mix with miscellaneous boys from a place called
      Brosely. Now, what on earth can he be coming here for, I wonder, Joseph?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, <i>I</i> know,&rsquo; the doctor answered with a deep-drawn sigh.
      &lsquo;I know, Maria, only too well. It&rsquo;s the way of all parents. He&rsquo;s
      come to inquire after Blenkinsopp major&rsquo;s health and progress. They
      all do it. They seem to think the sole object of a head-master&rsquo;s
      existence is to look after the comfort and morals of their own particular
      Tommy, or Bobby, or Dicky, or Harry. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, what form is
      Blenkinsopp major in? For heaven&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s his Christian
      name, and age last birthday, and place in French and mathematics, and
      general state of health for past quarter? Where&rsquo;s the prompt-book,
      with house-master&rsquo;s and form-master&rsquo;s report, Maria? Oh, here
      it is, thank goodness! Let me see; let me see&mdash;he&rsquo;s ringing at
      the door this very instant. &ldquo;Blenkinsopp... major... Charles
      Warrington... fifteen... fifth form... average, twelfth boy of twelve...
      idle, inattentive, naturally stupid; bad disposition... health invariably
      excellent... second eleven... bats well.&rdquo; That&rsquo;ll do. Run my
      eye down once again, and I shall remember all about him. How about the
      other? &ldquo;Blenkinsopp... minor... Cyril Anastasius Guy Waterbury
      Macfarlane&rdquo;&mdash;heavens, what a name!... &ldquo;thirteen... fourth
      form... average, seventh boy of eighteen... industrious and well-meaning,
      but heavy and ineffective... health good... fourth eleven... fields badly.&rdquo;
      Ah, that&rsquo;s the most important one. Now I&rsquo;m primed. Blenkinsopp
      major I remember something about, for he&rsquo;s one of the worst and most
      hopelessly stupid boys in the whole school&mdash;I&rsquo;ve caned him
      frequently this term, and that keeps a boy green in one&rsquo;s memory;
      but Blenkinsopp minor, Cyril Anastasius Guy Thingumbob Whatyoumaycallit,&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t remember HIM a bit. I suppose he&rsquo;s one of those
      inoffensive, mildly mediocre sort of boys who fail to impress their
      individuality upon one in any way. My experience is that you can always
      bear in mind the three cleverest boys at the top of each form, and the
      three stupidest or most mischievous boys at the bottom; but the nine or a
      dozen meritorious nobodies in the middle of the class are all so like one
      another in every way that you might as well try to discriminate between
      every individual sheep of a flock in a pasture. And yet, such is the
      natural contradictiousness and vexatious disposition of the British
      parent, that you&rsquo;ll always find him coming to inquire after just one
      of those very particular Tommies or Bobbies. Charles Warrington:&mdash;Cyril
      Anastasius Guy Whatyoumay&mdash;call it: that&rsquo;ll do: I shall
      remember now all about them.&rsquo; And the doctor arranged his hair
      before the looking glass into the most professional stiffness, as a
      preparatory step to facing Mr. Blenkinsopp&rsquo;s parental inquiries in
      the head-master&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What! Mr. Blenkinsopp! Yes, it is really. My dear sir, how DO you do?
      This is a most unexpected pleasure. We hadn&rsquo;t the least idea you
      were in Pilbury. When did you come here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I came last night, Dr. Greatrex,&rsquo; answered the dreaded parent
      respectfully: &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve come down from Staffordshire for a week
      at the seaside, and we thought we might as well be within hail of Guy and
      Charlie.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite right, quite right, my dear sir,&rsquo; said the doctor, mentally
      noting that Blenkinsopp minor was familiarly known as Guy, not Cyril;
      &lsquo;we&rsquo;re delighted to see you. And now you want to know all
      about our two young friends, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, yes, Dr. Greatrex; I SHOULD like to know how they are getting on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, of course, of course. Very right. It&rsquo;s such a pleasure to us
      when parents give us their active and hearty co-operation! You&rsquo;d
      hardly believe, Mr. Blenkinsopp, how little interest some parents seem to
      feel in their boys&rsquo; progress. To us, you know, who devote our whole
      time and energy assiduously to their ultimate welfare, it&rsquo;s
      sometimes quite discouraging to see how very little the parents themselves
      seem to care about it. But your boys are both doing capitally. The eldest&mdash;Blenkinsopp
      major, we call him; Charles Warrington, isn&rsquo;t it? (His home name&rsquo;s
      Charlie, if I recollect right. Ah, quite so.) Well, Charlie&rsquo;s the
      very picture of perfect health, as usual.&rsquo; (&lsquo;Health is his
      only strong point, it seems to me,&rsquo; the doctor thought to himself
      instinctively. &lsquo;We must put that first and foremost.&rsquo;) &lsquo;In
      excellent health and very good spirits. He&rsquo;s in the second eleven
      now, and a capital batter: I&rsquo;ve no doubt he&rsquo;ll go into the
      first eleven next term, if we lose Biddlecomb Tertius to the university.
      In work, as you know, he&rsquo;s not very great; doesn&rsquo;t do his
      abilities full justice, Mr. Blenkinsopp, through his dreadful inattention.
      He&rsquo;s generally near the bottom of the form, I&rsquo;m sorry to say;
      generally near the bottom of the form.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, I dare say there&rsquo;s no harm in that, sir,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Blenkinsopp, senior, warmly. &lsquo;I was always at the bottom of the form
      at school myself, Doctor, but I&rsquo;ve picked it up in after life; I&rsquo;ve
      picked it up, sir, as you see, and I&rsquo;m fully equal with most other
      people nowadays, as you&rsquo;ll find if you inquire of any town
      councilman or man of position down our way, at Brosely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, I dare say you were, Mr. Blenkinsopp,&rsquo; the doctor answered
      blandly, with just the faintest tinge of unconscious satire, peering at
      his square unintelligent features as a fancier peers at the face of a
      bull-dog; &lsquo;I dare say you were now. After all, however clever a set
      of boys may be, one of them MUST be at the bottom of the form, in the
      nature of things, mustn&rsquo;t he? And your Charlie, I think, is only
      fifteen. Ah, yes; well, well; he&rsquo;ll do better, no doubt, if we keep
      him here a year or two longer. So then there&rsquo;s the second: Guy, you
      call him, if I remember right&mdash;Cyril Anastasius Guy&mdash;our
      Blenkinsopp minor. Guy&rsquo;s a good boy; an excellent boy: to tell you
      the plain truth, Mr. Blenkinsopp, I don&rsquo;t know much of him
      personally myself, which is a fact that tells greatly in his favour.
      Charlie I must admit I have to call up some times for reproof: Guy, never.
      Charlie&rsquo;s in the fifth form: Guy&rsquo;s seventh in the fourth. A
      capital place for a boy of his age! He&rsquo;s very industrious, you know&mdash;what
      we call a plodder. They call it a plodder, you see, at thirteen, Mr.
      Blenkinsopp, but a man of ability at forty.&rsquo; Dr. Greatrex delivered
      that last effective shot point-blank at the eyes of the inquiring parent,
      and felt in a moment that its delicate generalised flattery had gone home
      straight to the parent&rsquo;s susceptible heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But there&rsquo;s one thing, Doctor,&rsquo; Mr. Blenkinsopp began, after
      a few minutes&rsquo; further conversation on the merits and failings of
      Guy and Charlie, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s one other thing I feel I should like
      to speak to you about, and that&rsquo;s the teaching of your fifth form
      master, Mr. Le Breton. From what Charlie tells me, I don&rsquo;t quite
      like that young man&rsquo;s political ideas and opinions. It&rsquo;s said
      things to his form sometimes that are quite horrifying, I assure you;
      things about Property, and about our duty to the poor, and so on, that are
      positively enough to appal you. Now, for example, he told them&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      quite like to repeat it, for it&rsquo;s sheer blasphemy I call it&mdash;but
      he told them in a Greek Testament lesson that the Apostles themselves were
      a sort of Republicans&mdash;Socialists, I think Charlie said, or else
      Chartists, or dynamiters. I&rsquo;m not sure he didn&rsquo;t say St. Peter
      himself was a regular communist!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Greatrex drew a long breath. &lsquo;I should think, Mr. Blenkinsopp,&rsquo;
      he suggested blandly, &lsquo;Charlie must really have misunderstood Mr. Le
      Breton. You see, they&rsquo;ve been reading the Acts of the Apostles in
      their Greek Testament this term. Now, of course, you remember that, during
      the first days of the infant Church, while its necessities were yet so
      great, as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and
      brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the
      apostles&rsquo; feet; and distribution was made unto every man according
      as he had need. You see, here&rsquo;s the passage, Mr. Blenkinsopp, in the
      authorised version. I won&rsquo;t trouble you with the original. You&rsquo;ve
      forgotten most of your Greek, I dare say: ah, I thought go. It doesn&rsquo;t
      stick to us like the Latin, does it? Now, perhaps, in expounding that
      passage, Mr. Le Breton may have referred in passing&mdash;as an
      illustration merely&mdash;to the unhappily prevalent modern doctrines of
      socialism and communism. He may have warned his boys, for example, against
      confounding a Christian communism like this, if I may so style it, with
      the rapacious, aggressive, immoral forms of communism now proposed to us,
      which are based upon the forcible disregard of all Property and all vested
      interests of every sort. I don&rsquo;t say he did, you know, for I haven&rsquo;t
      conferred with him upon the subject: but he may have done so; and he may
      even have used, as I have used, the phrase &ldquo;Christian communism,&rdquo;
      to define the temporary attitude of the apostles and the early Church in
      this matter. That, perhaps, my dear sir, may be the origin of the
      misapprehension.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blenkinsopp looked hard at the three verses in the big Bible the
      doctor had handed him, with a somewhat suspicious glare. He was a
      self-made man, with land and houses of his own in plenty, and he didn&rsquo;t
      quite like this suggestive talk about selling them and laying the prices
      at the apostles&rsquo; feet. It savoured to him both of communism and
      priestcraft. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s an awkward text, you know,&rsquo; he
      said, looking up curiously from the Bible in his hand into the doctor&rsquo;s
      face, &lsquo;a very awkward text; and I should say it was rather a
      dangerous one to set too fully before young people. It seems to me to make
      too little altogether of Property. You know, Dr. Greatrex, at first sight
      it DOES look just a little like communism.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Precisely what Mr. Le Breton probably said,&rsquo; the doctor answered,
      following up his advantage quickly. &lsquo;At first sight, no doubt, but
      at first sight only, I assure you, Mr. Blenkinsopp. If you look on to the
      fourth verse of the next chapter, you&rsquo;ll see that St. Peter, at
      least, was no communist,&mdash;which is perhaps what Mr. Le Breton really
      said. St. Peter there argues in favour of purely voluntary beneficence,
      you observe; as when you, Mr. Blenkinsopp, contribute a guinea to our
      chapel window:&mdash;you see, we&rsquo;re grateful to our kind
      benefactors: we don&rsquo;t forget them. And if you&rsquo;ll look at the
      Thirty-eighth Article of the Church of England, my dear sir, you&rsquo;ll
      find that the riches and goods of Christians are not common, as touching
      the right, title, and possession of the same as certain Anabaptists&mdash;(Gracious
      heavens, is he a Baptist, I wonder?&mdash;if so, I&rsquo;ve put my foot in
      it)&mdash;certain Anabaptists do falsely boast&mdash;referring, of course,
      to sundry German fanatics of the time&mdash;followers of one Kniperdoling,
      a crazy enthusiast, not to the respectable English Baptist denomination;
      but that nevertheless every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,
      liberally to give alms to the poor. That, you see, is the doctrine of the
      Church of England, and that, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, is the doctrine that Mr.
      Le Breton pointed out to your boys as the true Christian communism of St.
      Peter and the apostles.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, I hope so, Dr. Greatrex,&rsquo; Mr. Blenkinsopp answered
      resignedly. ‘I&rsquo;m sure I hope so, for his own sake, as well as for
      his pupils&rsquo;. Still, in these days, you know, when infidelity and
      Radicalism are so rife, one ought to be on one&rsquo;s guard against
      atheism and revolution, and attacks on Property in every form; oughtn&rsquo;t
      one, Doctor? These opinions are getting so rampant all around us, Property
      itself isn&rsquo;t safe. One really hardly knows what people are coming to
      nowadays. Why, last night I came down here and stopped at the Royal
      Marine, on the Parade, and having nothing else to do, while my wife was
      looking after the little ones, I turned into a hall down in Combe Street,
      where I saw a lot of placards up about a Grand National Social Democratic
      meeting. Well, I turned in, Dr. Greatrex, and there I heard a German
      refugee fellow from London&mdash;a white-haired man of the name of
      Schurts, or something of the sort&rsquo;&mdash;Mr. Blenkinsopp pronounced
      it to rhyme with &lsquo;hurts&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;who was declaiming away
      in a fashion to make your hair stand on end, and frighten you half out of
      your wits with his dreadful communistic notions. I assure you, he
      positively took my breath away. I ran out of the hall at last, while he
      was still speaking, for fear the roof should fall in upon our heads and
      crush us to pieces. I declare to you, sir, I quite expected a visible
      judgment!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Did you really now?&rsquo; said Dr. Greatrex, languidly. &lsquo;Well, I
      dare say, for I know there&rsquo;s a sad prevalence of revolutionary
      feeling among our workmen here, Mr. Blenkinsopp. Now, what was this man
      Schurz talking about?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, sheer communism, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Blenkinsopp, severely: &lsquo;sheer
      communism, I can tell you. Co-operation of workmen to rob their employers
      of profits; gross denunciation of capital and capitalists; and regular
      inciting of them against the Property of the landlords, by quoting
      Scripture, too, Doctor, by quoting the very words of Scripture. They say
      the devil can quote Scripture to his own destruction, don&rsquo;t they,
      Doctor? Well, he quoted something out of the Bible about woe unto them
      that join field to field, or words to that effect, to make themselves a
      solitude in the midst of the earth. Do you know, it strikes me that it&rsquo;s
      a very dangerous book, the Bible&mdash;in the hands of these socialistic
      demagogues, I mean. Look now, at that passage, and at what Mr. Le Breton
      said about Christian communism!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, my dear Mr. Blenkinsopp,&rsquo; the doctor cried, in a tone of
      gentle deprecation, &lsquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t confound a person like
      this man Schurz, a German refugee of the worst type, with our Mr. Le
      Breton, an Oxford graduate and an English gentleman of excellent family. I
      know Schurz by name through the papers: he&rsquo;s the author of a
      dreadful book called &ldquo;Gold and the Proletariate,&rdquo; or something
      of that sort&mdash;a revolutionary work like Tom Paine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Age
      of Reason,&rdquo; I believe&mdash;and he goes about the country now and
      then, lecturing and agitating, to make money, no doubt, out of the poor,
      misguided, credulous workmen. You quite pain me when you mention him in
      the same breath with a hard-working, conscientious, able teacher like our
      Mr. Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh,&rsquo; Mr. Blenkinsopp went on, a little mollified, &lsquo;then Mr.
      Le Breton&rsquo;s of a good family, is he? That&rsquo;s a great safeguard,
      at any rate, for you don&rsquo;t find people of good family running
      recklessly after these bloodthirsty doctrines, and disregarding the claims
      of Property.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear sir,&rsquo; the doctor continued, &lsquo;we know his mother, Lady
      Le Breton, personally. His father, Sir Owen, was a distinguished
      officer-general in the Indian army in fact; and all his people are
      extremely well connected with some of our best county families. Nothing
      wrong about him in any way, I can answer for it. He came here direct from
      Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s, where he&rsquo;d been acting as tutor to Viscount
      Lynmouth, the eldest son of the Tregellis family: and you may be sure THEY
      wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody about them in any capacity who wasn&rsquo;t
      thoroughly and perfectly responsible, and free from any prejudice against
      the just rights of property.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At each successive step of this collective guarantee to Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s
      perfect respectability, Mr. Blenkinsopp&rsquo;s square face beamed
      brighter and brighter, till at last when the name of Lord Exmour was
      finally reached, his mouth relaxed slowly into a broad smile, and he felt
      that he might implicitly trust the education of his boys to a person so
      intimately bound up with the best and highest interests of religion and
      Property in this kingdom. &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; he said placidly,
      &lsquo;that puts quite a different complexion upon the matter, Dr.
      Greatrex. I&rsquo;m very glad to hear young Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s such an
      excellent and trustworthy person. But the fact is, that Schurts man gave
      me quite a turn for the moment, with his sanguinary notions. I wish you
      could see the man, sir; a long white-haired, savage-bearded, fierce-eyed
      old revolutionist if ever there was one. It made me shudder to look at
      him, not raving and ranting like a madman&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      minded so much if he&rsquo;d a done that; but talking as cool and calm and
      collected, Doctor, about &ldquo;eliminating the capitalist&rdquo;&mdash;cutting
      off my head, in fact&mdash;as we two are talking here together at this
      moment. His very words were, sir, &ldquo;we must eliminate the capitalist.&rdquo;
      Why, bless my soul,&rsquo;&mdash;and here Mr. Blenkinsopp rushed to the
      window excitedly&mdash;&lsquo;who on earth&rsquo;s this coming across your
      lawn, here, arm in arm with Mr. Le Breton, into the school-house? Man
      alive, Dr. Greatrex, whatever you choose to say, hanged if it isn&rsquo;t
      realty that German cut-throat fellow himself, and no mistake at all about
      it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Greatrex rose from his magisterial chair and glanced with dignified
      composure out of the window. Yes, there was positively no denying it!
      Ernest Le Breton, in cap and gown, with Edie by his side, was walking arm
      in arm up to the school-house with a long-bearded, large-headed
      German-looking man, whose placid powerful face the Doctor immediately
      recognised as the one he had seen in the illustrated papers above the name
      of Max Schurz, the defendant in the coming state trial for unlawfully
      uttering a seditious libel! He could hardly believe his eyes. Though he
      knew Ernest&rsquo;s opinions were dreadfully advanced, he could not have
      suspected him of thus consorting with positive murderous political
      criminals. In spite of his natural and kindly desire to screen his own
      junior master, he felt that this public exhibition of irreconcilable views
      was quite unpardonable and irretrievable. &lsquo;Mr. Blenkinsopp,&rsquo;
      he said gravely, turning to the awe-struck tobacco-pipe manufacturer with
      an expression of sympathetic dismay upon his practised face, &lsquo;I must
      retract all I have just been saying to you about our junior master. I was
      not aware of this. Mr. Le Breton must no longer retain his post as an
      assistant at Pilbury Regis Grammar School.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blenkinsopp sank amazed into an easy-chair, and sat in dumb
      astonishment to see the end of this extraordinary and unprecedented
      adventure. The Doctor walked out severely to the school porch, and stood
      there in solemn state to await the approach of the unsuspecting offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s so delightful, dear Herr Max,&rsquo; Ernest was saying at that
      exact moment, &lsquo;to have you down here with us even for a single
      night. You can&rsquo;t imagine what an oasis your coming has been to us
      both. I&rsquo;m sure Edie has enjoyed it just as much as I have, and is
      just as anxious you should stop a little time here with us as I myself
      could possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, yes, Herr Schurz,&rsquo; Edie put in persuasively with her sweet
      little pleading manner; &lsquo;do stay a little longer. I don&rsquo;t know
      when dear Ernest has enjoyed anything in the world so much as he has
      enjoyed seeing you. You&rsquo;ve no idea how dull it is down here for him,
      and for me too, for that matter; everybody here is so borné, and
      narrow-minded and self-centred; nothing expansive or sympathetic about
      them, as there used to be about Ernest&rsquo;s set in dear, quiet,
      peaceable old Oxford. It&rsquo;s been such a pleasure to us to hear some
      conversation again that wasn&rsquo;t about the school, and the rector, and
      the Haigh Park people, and the flower show, and old Mrs. Jenkins&rsquo;s
      quarrel with the vicar of St. Barnabas. Except when Mr. Berkeley runs down
      sometimes for a Saturday to Monday trip to see us, and takes Ernest out
      for a good blow with him on the top of the breezy downs over yonder, we
      really never hear anything at all except the gossip and the small-talk of
      Pilbury Regis.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what makes it worse, Herr Max,&rsquo; said Ernest, looking up in the
      old man&rsquo;s calm strong face with the same reverent almost filial love
      and respect as ever, &lsquo;is the fact that I can&rsquo;t feel any real
      interest and enthusiasm in the work that&rsquo;s set before me. I try to
      do it as well as I can, and I believe Dr. Greatrex, who&rsquo;s a
      kind-hearted good sort of man in his way, is perfectly satisfied with it;
      but my heart isn&rsquo;t in it, you see, and can&rsquo;t be in it. What
      sort of good is one doing the world by dinning the same foolish round of
      Horace and Livy and Latin elegiacs into the heads of all these useless,
      eat-all, do-nothing young fellows, who&rsquo;ll only be fit to fight or
      preach or idle as soon as we&rsquo;ve finished cramming them with our
      indigestible unserviceable nostrums!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, Ernest, Ernest,&rsquo; said Herr Max, nodding his heavy head gravely,
      ‘you always WILL look too seriously altogether at your social duties. I
      can&rsquo;t get other people to do it enough; and I can&rsquo;t get you
      not to do it too much entirely. Remember, my dear boy, my pet old saying
      about a little leaven. You&rsquo;re doing more good by just unobtrusively
      holding your own opinions here at Pilbury, and getting in the thin end of
      the wedge by slowly influencing the minds of a few middle-class boys in
      your form, than you could possibly be doing by making shoes or weaving
      clothes for the fractional benefit of general humanity. Don&rsquo;t be so
      abstract, Ernest; concrete yourself a little; isn&rsquo;t it enough that
      you&rsquo;re earning a livelihood for your dear little wife here, whom I&rsquo;m
      glad to know at last and to receive as a worthy daughter? I may call you,
      Edie, mayn&rsquo;t I, my daughter? So this is your school, is it? A
      pleasant building! And that stern-looking old gentleman yonder, I suppose,
      is your head master?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dr. Greatrex,&rsquo; said Edie innocently, stepping up to him in her
      bright elastic fashion, &lsquo;let me introduce you to our friend Herr
      Schurz, whose name I dare say you know&mdash;the German political
      economist. He&rsquo;s come down to Pilbury to deliver a lecture here, and
      we&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to put him up at our little lodging.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor bowed very stiffly. &lsquo;I have heard of Herr Schurz&rsquo;s
      reputation already,&rsquo; he said with as much diplomatic politeness as
      he could command, fortunately bethinking himself at the right moment of
      the exact phrase that would cover the situation without committing him to
      any further courtesy towards the terrible stranger. ‘Will you excuse my
      saying, Mrs. Le Breton, that we&rsquo;re very busy this afternoon, and I
      want to have a few words with your husband in private immediately? Perhaps
      you&rsquo;d better take Herr Schurz on to the downs&rsquo; (&lsquo;safer
      there than on the Parade, at any rate,&rsquo; he thought to himself
      quickly), &lsquo;and Le Breton will join you in the combe a little later
      in the afternoon. I&rsquo;ll take the fifth form myself, and let him have
      a holiday with his friend here if he&rsquo;d like one. Le Breton, will you
      step this way please?&rsquo; And lifting his square cap with stern
      solemnity to Edie, the doctor disappeared under the porch into the
      corridor, closely followed by poor frightened and wondering Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie looked at Herr Max in dismay, for she saw clearly there was something
      serious the matter with the doctor. The old man shook his head sadly.
      &lsquo;It was very wrong of me,&rsquo; he said bitterly: &lsquo;very wrong
      and very thoughtless. I ought to have remembered it and stopped away. I&rsquo;m
      a caput lupinum, it seems, in Pilbury Regis, a sort of moral scarecrow or
      political leper, to be carefully avoided like some horrid contagion by a
      respectable, prosperous head-master. I might have known it, I might have
      known it, Edie; and now I&rsquo;m afraid by my stupidity I&rsquo;ve got
      dear Ernest unintentionally into a pack of troubles. Come on, my child, my
      poor dear child, come on to the downs, as he told us; I won&rsquo;t
      compromise you any longer by being seen with you in the streets, in the
      decent decorous whited sepulchres of Pilbury Regis.&rsquo; And the grey
      old apostle, with two tears trickling unreproved down his wrinkled cheek,
      took Edie&rsquo;s arm tenderly in his, and led her like a father up to the
      green grassy slope that overlooks the little seaward combe by the nestling
      village of Nether Pilbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Dr. Greatrex had taken Ernest into the breakfast-room&mdash;the
      study was already monopolised by Mr. Blenkinsopp&mdash;and had seated
      himself nervously, with his hands folded before him, on a straight-backed
      chair There was a long and awkward pause, for the doctor didn&rsquo;t care
      to begin the interview; but at last he sighed deeply and said in a tone of
      genuine disappointment and difficulty, &lsquo;My dear Le Breton, this is
      really very unpleasant.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest looked at him, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you know,&rsquo; the doctor went on kindly after a minute, &lsquo;I
      really do like you and sympathise with you. But what am I to do after
      this? I can&rsquo;t keep you at the school any longer, can I now? I put it
      to your own common-sense. I&rsquo;m afraid, Le Breton&mdash;it gives me
      sincere pain to say so&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid we must part at the end
      of the quarter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest only muttered that he was very sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But what are we to do about it, Le Breton?&rsquo; the doctor continued
      more kindly than ever. &lsquo;What are we ever to do about it? For my own
      sake, and for the boys&rsquo; sake, and for respectability&rsquo;s sake,
      it&rsquo;s quite impossible to let you remain here any longer. The first
      thing you must do is to send away this Schurz creature&rsquo;&mdash;Ernest
      started a little&mdash;&lsquo;and then we must try to let it blow over as
      best we can. Everybody&rsquo;ll be talking about it; you know the man&rsquo;s
      become quite notorious lately; and it&rsquo;ll be quite necessary to say
      distinctly, Le Breton, before the whole of Pilbury, that we&rsquo;ve been
      obliged to dismiss you summarily. So much we positively MUST do for our
      own protection. But what on earth are we to do for you, my poor fellow? I&rsquo;m
      afraid you&rsquo;ve cut your own throat, and I don&rsquo;t see any way on
      earth out of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How so?&rsquo; asked Ernest, half stunned by the suddenness of this
      unexpected dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, just look the thing in the face yourself, Le Breton. I can&rsquo;t
      very well give you a recommendation to any other head master without
      mentioning to him why I had to ask you for your resignation. And I&rsquo;m
      afraid if I told them, nobody else would ever take you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed?&rsquo; said Ernest, very softly. &lsquo;Is it such a heinous
      offence to know so good a man as Herr Schurz&mdash;the best follower of
      the apostles I ever knew?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear fellow,&rsquo; said the doctor, confidentially, with an unusual
      burst of outspoken frankness, &lsquo;so far as my own private feelings are
      concerned, I don&rsquo;t in the least object to your knowing Herr Schurz
      or any other socialist whatsoever. To tell you the truth, I dare say he
      really is an excellent and most well-meaning person at bottom. Between
      ourselves, I&rsquo;ve always thought that there was nothing very heterodox
      in socialism; in fact, I often think, Le Breton, the Bible&rsquo;s the
      most thoroughly democratic book that ever was written. But we haven&rsquo;t
      got to deal in practice with first principles; we have to deal with
      Society&mdash;with men and women as we find them. Now, Society doesn&rsquo;t
      like your Herr Schurz, objects to him, anathematises him, wants to
      imprison him. If you walk about with him in public, Society won&rsquo;t
      send its sons to your school. Therefore, you should disguise your
      affection, and if you want to visit him, you should visit him, like
      Nicodemus, by night only.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said Ernest very fixedly, &lsquo;I shall never
      be able so far to accommodate myself to the wishes of Society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid not, myself, Le Breton,&rsquo; the doctor went on with
      imperturbable good temper. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, and I&rsquo;m
      sorry for it. The fact is, you&rsquo;ve chosen the wrong profession. You
      haven&rsquo;t pliability enough for a schoolmaster; you&rsquo;re too
      isolated, too much out of the common run; your ideas are too peculiar.
      Now, you&rsquo;ve got me to-day into a dreadful pickle, and I might very
      easily be angry with you about it, and part with you in bad blood; but I
      really like you, Le Breton, and I don&rsquo;t want to do that; so I only
      tell you plainly, you&rsquo;ve mistaken your natural calling. What it can
      be I don&rsquo;t know; but we must put our two heads together, and see
      what we can do for you before the end of the quarter. Now, go up to the
      combe to your wife, and try to get that terrible bugbear of a German out
      of Pilbury as quickly and as quietly as possible. Good-bye for to-day, Le
      Breton; no coolness between us, for this, I hope, my dear fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest grasped his hand warmly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, Dr.
      Greatrex,&rsquo; he said with genuine feeling. &lsquo;I see you mean well
      by me, and I&rsquo;m very, very sorry if I&rsquo;ve unintentionally caused
      you any embarrassment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all, not at all, my dear fellow. Don&rsquo;t mention it. We&rsquo;ll
      tide it over somehow, and I&rsquo;ll see whether I can get you anything
      else to do that you&rsquo;re better fitted for.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed on Ernest, the doctor just gently wiped a certain
      unusual dew off his gold spectacles with a corner of his spotless
      handkerchief. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rsquo; he murmured to
      himself, ‘an excellent fellow; but he doesn&rsquo;t manage to combine with
      the innocence of the dove the wisdom of the serpent. Poor boy, poor boy, I&rsquo;m
      afraid he&rsquo;ll sink, but we must do what we can to keep his chin
      floating above the water. And now I must go back to the study to have out
      my explanation with that detestable thick-headed old pig of a Blenkinsopp!
      &ldquo;Your views about young Le Breton,&rdquo; I must say to him, &ldquo;are
      unfortunately only too well founded; and I have been compelled to dismiss
      him this very hour from Pilbury Grammar School.&rdquo; Ugh&mdash;how
      humiliating! the profession&rsquo;s really enough to give one a perfect
      sickening of life altogether!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; THE STREETS OF ASKELON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before the end of the quarter, two things occurred which made almost as
      serious a difference to Ernest&rsquo;s and Edie&rsquo;s lives as the
      dismissal from Pilbury Regis Grammar School. It was about a week or ten
      days after Herr Max&rsquo;s unfortunate visit that Ernest awoke one
      morning with a very curious and unpleasant taste in his mouth, accompanied
      by a violent fit of coughing. He knew what the taste was well enough; and
      he mentioned the matter casually to Edie a little later in the morning.
      Edie was naturally frightened at the symptoms, and made him go to see the
      school doctor. The doctor felt his pulse attentively, listened with his
      stethoscope at the chest, punched and pummelled the patient all over in
      the most orthodox fashion, and asked the usual inquisitorial personal
      questions about all the other members of his family. When he heard about
      Ronald&rsquo;s predisposition, he shook his head seriously, and feared
      there was really something in it. Increased vocal resonance at the top of
      the left lung, he must admit. Some tendency to tubercular deposit there,
      and perhaps even a slight deep-seated cavity. Ernest must take care of
      himself for the present, and keep himself as free as possible from all
      kind of worry or anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it consumption, do you think, Dr. Sanders?&rsquo; Edie asked
      breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, consumption, Mrs. Le Breton, is a very vague and indefinite
      expression,&rsquo; said the doctor, tapping his white shirtcuff with his
      nail in his slowest and most deliberate manner. &lsquo;It may mean a great
      deal, or it may mean very little. I don&rsquo;t want in any way to alarm
      you, or to alarm your husband; but there&rsquo;s certainly a marked
      incipient tendency towards tubercular deposit. Yes, tubercular deposit...
      Well, if you ask me the question point-blank, I should say so...
      certainly... I should say it was phthisis, very little doubt of it... In
      short, what some people would call consumption.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest went home with Edie, comforting her all the way as well as he was
      able, and trying to make light of it, but feeling in his own heart that
      the look-out was decidedly beginning to gather blacker and darker than
      ever before them. Through the rest of that term he worked as well as he
      could; but Edie noticed every morning that the cough was getting worse and
      worse; and long before the time came for them to leave Pilbury he had
      begun to look distinctly delicate. Care for Edie and for the future was
      telling on him: his frame had never been very robust, and the anxieties of
      the last year had brought out the same latent hereditary tendency which
      had shown itself earlier and more markedly in the case of his brother
      Ronald.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Dr. Greatrex was assiduous in looking about for something or
      other that Ernest could turn his hand to, and writing letters with
      indefatigable kindness to all his colleagues and correspondents: for
      though he was, as Ernest said, a most unmitigated humbug, that was really
      his only fault; and when his sympathies were once really aroused, as the
      Le Bretons had aroused them, there was no stone he would leave unturned if
      only his energy could be of any service to those whom he wished to
      benefit. But unfortunately in this case it couldn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      at my wit&rsquo;s end what to do with you, Le Breton,&rsquo; he said
      kindly one morning to Ernest: &lsquo;but how on earth I&rsquo;m to manage
      anything, I can&rsquo;t imagine. For my own part, you know, though your
      conduct about that poor man Schurz (a well-meaning harmless fanatic, I
      dare say) was really a public scandal&mdash;from the point of view of
      parents I mean, my dear fellow, from the point of view of parents&mdash;I
      should almost be inclined to keep you on here in spite of it, and brave
      the public opinion of Pilbury Regis, if it depended entirely upon my own
      judgment. But in the management of a school, my dear boy, as you yourself
      must be aware, a head master isn&rsquo;t the sole and only authority;
      there are the governors, for example, Le Breton, and&mdash;and&mdash;and,
      ur, there&rsquo;s Mrs. Greatrex. Now, in all matters of social discipline
      and attitude, Mrs. Greatrex is justly of equal authority with me; and Mrs.
      Greatrex thinks it would never do to keep you at Pilbury. So, of course,
      that practically settles the question. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Le Breton,
      dreadfully sorry, but I don&rsquo;t see my way out of it. The mischief&rsquo;s
      done already, to some extent, for all Pilbury knows now that Schurz came
      down here to stop with you at your lodgings: but if I were to keep you on
      they&rsquo;d say I didn&rsquo;t disapprove of Schurz&rsquo;s opinions, and
      that would naturally be simple ruination for the school&mdash;simple
      ruination.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest thanked him sincerely for the trouble he had taken, but wondered
      desperately in his own heart what sort of future could ever be in store
      for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second event was less unexpected, though quite equally embarrassing
      under existing circumstances. Hardly more than a month before the end of
      the quarter, a little black-eyed baby daughter came to add to the
      prospective burdens of the Le Breton family. She was a wee, fat,
      round-faced, dimpled Devonshire lass to look at, as far surpassing every
      previous baby in personal appearance as each of those previous babies, by
      universal admission, had surpassed all their earlier predecessors&mdash;a
      fact which, as Mr. Sanders remarked, ought to be of most gratifying import
      both to evolutionists and to philanthropists in general, as proving the
      continuous and progressive amelioration of the human race: and Edie was
      very proud of her indeed, as she lay placidly in her very plain little
      white robes on the pillow of her simple wickerwork cradle. But Ernest,
      though he learned to love the tiny intruder dearly afterwards, had no
      heart just then to bear the conventional congratulations of his friends
      and fellow-masters. Another mouth to feed, another life dependent upon
      him, and little enough, as it seemed, for him to feed it with. When Edie
      asked him what they should name the baby&mdash;he had just received an
      adverse answer to his application for a vacant secretaryship&mdash;he
      crumpled up the envelope bitterly in his hand, and cried out in his
      misery, &lsquo;Call her Pandora, Edie, call her Pandora; for we&rsquo;ve
      got to the very bottom of the casket, and there is nothing at all left for
      us now but hope&mdash;and even of that very little!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they duly registered her name as Pandora; but her mother shortened it
      familiarly into Dot; and as little Dot she was practically known ever
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as soon as poor Edie was able to get about again, the time came
      when they would have to leave Pilbury Regis. The doctor&rsquo;s search had
      been quite ineffectual, and he had heard of absolutely nothing that was at
      all likely to suit Ernest Le Breton. He had tried Government offices,
      Members of Parliament, colonial friends, every body he knew in any way who
      might possibly know of vacant posts or appointments, but each answer was
      only a fresh disappointment for him and for Ernest. In the end, he was
      fain to advise his peccant under-master, since nothing else remained for
      it, that he had better go up to London for the present, take lodgings, and
      engage in the precarious occupation known as &lsquo;looking about for
      something to turn up.&rsquo; On the morning when Edie and he were to leave
      the town, Dr. Greatrex saw Ernest privately in his own study.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wish very much I could have gone to the station to see you off, Le
      Breton,&rsquo; he said, pressing his hand warmly; &lsquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t
      do, you know, it wouldn&rsquo;t do, and Mrs. Greatrex wouldn&rsquo;t like
      it. People would say I sympathised secretly with your political opinions,
      which might offend Sir Matthew Ogle and others of our governors. But I&rsquo;m
      sorry to get rid of you, really and sincerely sorry, my dear fellow; and
      apart from personal feeling, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d have made a good
      master in most ways, if it weren&rsquo;t for your most unfortunate
      socialistic notions. Get rid of them, Le Breton, I beg of you: do get rid
      of them. Well, the only thing I can advise you now is to try your hand,
      for the present only&mdash;till something turns up, you know&mdash;at
      literature and journalism. I shall be on the look-out for you still, and
      shall tell you at once of anything I may happen to hear of. But meanwhile,
      you must try to be earning something. And if at any time, my dear friend,
      you should be temporarily in want of money,&rsquo;&mdash;the doctor said
      this in a shame-faced, hesitating sort of way, with not a little humming
      and hawing&mdash;&lsquo;in want of money for immediate necessities merely,
      if you&rsquo;ll only be so kind as to write and tell me, I should consider
      it a pleasure and a privilege to lend you a ten pound note, you know&mdash;just
      for a short time, till you saw your way clear before you. Don&rsquo;t
      hesitate to ask me now, be sure; and I may as well say, write to me at the
      school, Le Breton, not at the school-house, so that even Mrs. Greatrex
      need never know anything about it. In fact, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ve
      put a small sum into this envelope&mdash;only twenty pounds&mdash;which
      may be of service to you, as a loan, as a loan merely; if you&rsquo;ll
      take it&mdash;only till something turns up, you know&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      really be conferring a great favour upon me. There, there, my dear boy;
      now don&rsquo;t be offended: I&rsquo;ve borrowed money myself at times,
      when I was a young man like you, and I hadn&rsquo;t a wife and family then
      as an excuse for it either. Put it in your pocket, there&rsquo;s a good
      fellow; you&rsquo;ll need it for Mrs. Le Breton and the baby, you see; now
      do please put it in your pocket.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears rode fast and hot in Ernest&rsquo;s eyes, and he grasped the
      doctor&rsquo;s other hand with grateful fervour. &lsquo;Dear Dr. Greatrex,&rsquo;
      he said as well as he was able, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s too kind of you, too
      kind of you altogether. But I really can&rsquo;t take the money. Even
      after the expenses of Edie&rsquo;s illness and of baby Dot&rsquo;s
      wardrobe, we have a little sum, a very little sum laid by, that&rsquo;ll
      help us to tide over the immediate present. It&rsquo;s too good of you,
      too good of you altogether. I shall remember your kindness for ever with
      the most sincere and heartfelt gratitude.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ernest looked into the doctor&rsquo;s half-averted eyes, swimming and
      glistening just a little with sympathetic moisture, his heart smote him
      when he thought that he had ever described that good, kindly, generous man
      as an unmitigated humbug. &lsquo;It shows how little one can trust the
      mere outside shell of human beings,&rsquo; he said to Edie,
      self-reproachfully, as they sat together in their hare third-class
      carriage an hour later. &lsquo;The humbug&rsquo;s just the conventional
      mask of his profession&mdash;necessary enough, I suppose, for people who
      are really going to live successfully in the world as we find it: the
      heart within him&rsquo;s a thousand times warmer and truer and more
      unspoiled than one could ever have imagined from the outer covering. He
      offered me his twenty pounds so delicately and considerately that but for
      my father&rsquo;s blood in me, Edie, for your sake, I believe I could
      almost have taken it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got to London, Ernest wished to leave Edie and Dot at Arthur
      Berkeley&rsquo;s rooms (he knew nowhere else to leave them), while he went
      out by himself to look about for cheap lodgings. Edie was still too weak,
      he said, to carry her baby about the streets of London in search of
      apartments. But Edie wouldn&rsquo;t hear of this arrangement; she didn&rsquo;t
      quite like going to Arthur&rsquo;s, and she felt sure she could bargain
      with the London landladies a great deal more effectually than a man like
      Ernest&mdash;which was an important matter in the present very reduced
      condition of the family finances. In the end it was agreed that they
      should both go out on the hunt together, but that Ernest should be
      permitted to relieve Edie by turns in taking care of the precious baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They&rsquo;re dreadful people, I believe, London landladies,&rsquo; said
      Edie, in her most housewifely manner; &lsquo;regular cheats and
      skinflints, I&rsquo;ve always heard, who try to take you in on every
      conceivable point and item. We must be very careful not to let them get
      the better of us, Ernest, and to make full inquiries about all extras, and
      so forth, beforehand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned towards Holloway and the northern district, to look for cheap
      rooms, and they saw a great many, more or less dear, and more or less
      dirty and unsuitable, until their poor hearts really began to sink within
      them. At last, in despair, Edie turned up a small side street in Holloway,
      and stopped at a tiny house with a clean white curtain in its wee front
      bay window. &lsquo;This is awfully small, Ernest,&rsquo; she said,
      despondently, &lsquo;but perhaps, after all, it might really suit us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened for them by a tall, raw-boned, hard-faced woman, the
      very embodiment and personification of Edie&rsquo;s ideal skinflint London
      landlady. Might they see the lodgings, Edie asked dubiously. Yes, they
      might, indeed, mum, answered the hard-faced woman. Edie glanced at Ernest
      significantly, as who should say that these would really never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lodgings were very small, but they were as clean as a new pin. Edie
      began to relent, and thought, perhaps in spite of the landlady, they might
      somehow manage to put up with them. &lsquo;What was the rent?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard-faced landlady looked at Edie steadily, and then answered
      ‘Fifteen shillings, mum.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, that&rsquo;s too much for us, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said Edie
      ruefully. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want to go as high as that. We&rsquo;re
      very poor and quiet people.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, mum,&rsquo; the landlady assented quickly, &lsquo;it is &lsquo;igh
      for the rooms, perhaps, mum, though I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad more; but it IS
      &lsquo;igh, mum. I won&rsquo;t deny it. Still, for you, mum, and the baby,
      I wouldn&rsquo;t mind making it twelve and sixpence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Couldn&rsquo;t you say half-a-sovereign?&rsquo; Edie asked timidly,
      emboldened by success.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Arf a suvveran, mum? Well, I &lsquo;ardly rightly know,&rsquo; said the
      hard-faced landlady deliberately. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say without askin&rsquo;
      of my &lsquo;usband whether he&rsquo;ll let me. Excuse me a minnit, mum; I&rsquo;ll
      just run down and ask &lsquo;im.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie glanced at Ernest, and whispered doubtfully, &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll do,
      but I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s a dreadful person.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the hard-faced landlady had run downstairs quickly, and called
      out in a pleasant voice of childish excitement to her husband. &lsquo;John,
      John,&rsquo; she cried&mdash;&lsquo;drat that man, where&rsquo;s he gone
      to. Oh, a smokin&rsquo; of course, in the back kitching. Oh, John, there&rsquo;s
      the sweetest little lady you ever set eyes on, all in black, with a dear
      baby, a dear little speechless infant, and a invalid &lsquo;usband, I
      should say by the look of &lsquo;im, &lsquo;as come to ask the price of
      the ground floor lodgin&rsquo;s. And seein&rsquo; she was so nice and
      kindlike, I told her fifteen shillings, instead of a suvveran; and she
      says, can&rsquo;t you let &lsquo;em for less? says she; and she was that
      pretty and engagin&rsquo; that I says, well, for you I&rsquo;ll make it
      twelve and sixpence, mum, says I: and says she, you couldn&rsquo;t say
      &lsquo;arf a suvveran, could you? and says I, I&rsquo;ll ask my &lsquo;usband:
      and oh, John, I DO wish you&rsquo;d let me take &lsquo;em at that, for a
      kinder, sweeter-lookin&rsquo; dearer family I never did, an&rsquo; that I
      tell you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John drew his pipe slowly out of his mouth&mdash;he was a big, heavy,
      coachman-built sort of person, in waistcoat and shirt-sleeves&mdash;and
      answered with a kindly smile, &lsquo;Why, Martha, if you want to take
      &lsquo;em for &lsquo;arf a suvveran, in course you&rsquo;d ought to do it.
      Got a baby, pore thing, &lsquo;ave she now? Well, there, there, you just
      go this very minnit, and tell &lsquo;em as you&rsquo;ll take &lsquo;em.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard-faced landlady went up the stairs again, only stopping a moment
      to observe parenthetically that a sweeter little lady she never did, and
      what was &lsquo;arf-a-crown a week to you and me, John? and then, holding
      the corner of her apron in her hand, she informed Edie that her &lsquo;usband
      was prepared to accept the ten shillings weekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ll try to make you and the gentleman comfortable, mum,&rsquo; she
      said, eagerly; &lsquo;the gentleman don&rsquo;t look strong, now do he? We
      must try to feed &lsquo;im up and keep &lsquo;im cheerful. And we&rsquo;ve
      got plenty of flowers to make the room bright, you see: I&rsquo;m very
      fond of flowers myself, mum: seems to me as if they was sort of company to
      one, like, and when you water &lsquo;em and tend &lsquo;em always, I feel
      as if they was alive, and got to know one again, I do, and that makes one
      love ‘em, now don&rsquo;t it, mum? To see &lsquo;em brighten up after you&rsquo;ve
      watered ‘em, like that there maiden-&rsquo;air fern there, why it&rsquo;s
      enough to make one love &lsquo;em the same as if they was Christians, mum.&rsquo;
      There was a melting tenderness in her voice when she talked about the
      flowers that half won over Edie&rsquo;s heart, even in spite of her hard
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re so fond of flowers, Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;. Oh,
      you haven&rsquo;t told us your name yet,&rsquo; Edie said, beginning
      vaguely to suspect that perhaps the hard-faced landlady wasn&rsquo;t quite
      as bad as she looked to a casual observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Alliss, mum,&rsquo; the landlady answered, filling up Edie&rsquo;s
      interrogatory blank. &lsquo;My name is &lsquo;Alliss.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Alice what?&rsquo; Edie asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, no, mum, you don&rsquo;t rightly understand me,&rsquo; the landlady
      replied, getting very red, and muddling up her aspirates more decidedly
      than ever, as people with her failing always do when they want to be
      specially deliberate and emphatic: &lsquo;not Halice, but &lsquo;Alliss;
      haitch, hay, hell, hell, hi, double hess&mdash;&lsquo;Alliss: my full name&rsquo;s
      Martha &lsquo;Alliss, mum; my &lsquo;usband&rsquo;s John &lsquo;Alliss.
      When would you like to come in?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘At once,&rsquo; Edie answered. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve left our luggage at the
      cloak-room at Waterloo, and my husband will go back and fetch it, while I
      stop here with the baby.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not that, he shan&rsquo;t, indeed, mum,&rsquo; cried the hard-faced
      landlady, hastily; &lsquo;beggin&rsquo; your pardon for sayin&rsquo; so.
      Our John shall go&mdash;that&rsquo;s my &lsquo;usband, mum; and you shall
      give &lsquo;im the ticket. I wouldn&rsquo;t let your good gentleman there
      go, and &lsquo;im so tired, too, not for the world, I wouldn&rsquo;t. Just
      you give me the ticket, mum, and John shall go this very minnit and fetch
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But perhaps your husband&rsquo;s busy,&rsquo; said Ernest, reflecting
      upon the probable cost of cab hire; &lsquo;and he&rsquo;ll want a cab to
      fetch it in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bless your &lsquo;eart, sir,&rsquo; said the landlady, busily arranging
      things all round the room meanwhile for the better accommodation of the
      baby, &lsquo;&rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t noways busy &lsquo;e ain&rsquo;t.
      &lsquo;E&rsquo;s a lazy man, nowadays, John is: retired from business,
      &lsquo;e says, sir, and ain&rsquo;t got nothink to do but clean the
      knives, and lay the fires, and split the firewood, and such like. John
      were a coachman, sir, in a gentleman&rsquo;s family for most of &lsquo;is
      life, man and boy, these forty year, come Christmas; and we&rsquo;ve saved
      a bit o&rsquo; money between us, so as we don&rsquo;t need for nothink:
      and &lsquo;e don&rsquo;t want the cab, puttin&rsquo; you to expense, sir,
      onnecessary, to bring the luggage round in. &lsquo;E&rsquo;ll just borrer
      the hand-barrer from the livery in the mews, sir, and wheel it round
      ‘isself, in &lsquo;arf an hour, and make nothink of it. Just you give me
      the ticket, and set you right down there, and I&rsquo;ll make you and the
      lady a cup of tea at once, and John&rsquo;ll bring round the luggage by
      the time you&rsquo;ve got your things off.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest looked at Edie, and Edie looked at Ernest. Could they have judged
      too hastily once more, after their determination to be lenient in first
      judgments for the future? So Ernest gave Mrs. Halliss the cloak-room
      ticket, and Mrs. Halliss ran downstairs with it immediately. &lsquo;John,&rsquo;
      the cried again, &lsquo;&mdash;drat that man, where&rsquo;s &lsquo;e gone
      to? Oh, there you are, dearie! Just you put on your coat an&rsquo; &lsquo;at
      as fast as ever you can, and borrer Tom Wood&rsquo;s barrer, and run down
      to Waterloo, and fetch up them two portmanteaus, will you? And you drop in
      on the way at the Waterfield dairy&mdash;not Jenkins&rsquo;s: Jenkins&rsquo;s
      milk ain&rsquo;t good enough for them&mdash;and tell &lsquo;em to send
      round two penn&rsquo;orth of fresh this very minnit, do y&rsquo;ear, John,
      this very minnit, as it&rsquo;s extremely pertickler. And a good thing I
      didn&rsquo;t give you them two eggs for your dinner, as is fresh-laid by
      our own &lsquo;ens this mornin&rsquo;, and no others like &lsquo;em to be
      &lsquo;ad in London for love or money; and they shall &lsquo;ave &lsquo;em
      boiled light for their tea this very evenin&rsquo;. And you look sharp,
      John,&mdash;drat the man, &lsquo;ow long &lsquo;e is&mdash;for I tell yon,
      these is reel gentlefolk, and them pore too, which makes it all the
      &lsquo;arder; and they&rsquo;ve got to be treated the same in every
      respect as if they was paying a &lsquo;ole suvverin, bless their &lsquo;earts,
      the pore creechurs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pore,&rsquo; said John, vainly endeavouring to tear on his coat with
      becoming rapidity under the influence of Mrs. Halliss&rsquo;s voluble
      exhortations. &lsquo;Pore are they, pore things? and so they may be. I&rsquo;ve
      knowed the sons of country gentlemen, and that baronights too, Martha, as
      &lsquo;ad kep&rsquo; their &lsquo;ounds, redooced to be that pore as they
      couldn&rsquo;t have afforded to a took our lodgings, even &lsquo;umble as
      they may be. Pore ain&rsquo;t nothink to do with it noways, as respecks
      gentility. I&rsquo;ve lived forty years in gentlemen&rsquo;s families, up
      an&rsquo; down, Martha, and I think I&rsquo;d ought to know somethink
      about the ‘abits and manners of the aristocracy. Pore ain&rsquo;t in the
      question at all, it ain&rsquo;t, as far as breedin&rsquo; goes: and if
      they&rsquo;re pore, and got to be gentlefolks too all the same&rsquo;&mdash;John
      spoke of this last serious disability in a tone of unfeigned pity&mdash;&lsquo;why,
      Martha, wot I says is, we&rsquo;d ought to do the very best we can for
      &lsquo;em any &lsquo;ow, now, oughtn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Drat the man!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Halliss again, impatiently; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      stand talkin&rsquo; and sermonin&rsquo; about it there no longer like a
      poll parrot, but just you run along and send in the milk, like a dear,
      will you? or that dear little lady&rsquo;ll have to be waitin&rsquo; for
      her tea&mdash;and her with a month-old baby, too, the pretty thing, just
      to think of it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, long before John Halliss had got back again with the two wee
      portmanteaus&mdash;&lsquo;I could &lsquo;a carried that lot on my &lsquo;ead,&rsquo;
      he soliloquised when he saw them, &lsquo;without &lsquo;avin&rsquo;
      troubled to wheel round a onnecessary encumbrance in the way of a barrer&rsquo;&mdash;Mrs.
      Halliss had put the room tidy, and laid the baby carefully in a borrowed
      cradle in the corner, and brought up Edie and Ernest a big square tray
      covered by a snow-white napkin&mdash;&lsquo;My own washin&rsquo;, mum&rsquo;&mdash;and
      conveying a good cup of tea, a couple of crisp rolls, and two such
      delicious milky eggs as were never before known in the whole previous
      history of the county of Middlesex. And while they drank their tea, Mrs.
      Halliss insisted upon taking the baby down into the kitchen, so that they
      mightn&rsquo;t be bothered, pore things; for the pore lady must be tired
      with nursin&rsquo; of it herself the livelong day, that she must: and when
      she got it into the kitchen, she was compelled to call over the back yard
      wall to Mrs. Bollond, the greengrocer&rsquo;s wife next door, with the
      ultimate view to getting a hare&rsquo;s brain for the dear baby to suck at
      through a handkerchief. And Mrs. Bollond, being specially so invited, came
      in by the area door, and inspected the dear baby; and both together
      arrived at the unanimous conclusion that little Dot was the very prettiest
      and sweetest child that ever sucked its fat little fingers, Lord bless
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the neat wee parlour upstairs, Edie, pouring out tea from the
      glittering tin teapot into one of the scrupulously clean small whitey-gold
      teacups, was saying meanwhile to Ernest, &lsquo;Well, after all, Ernest
      dear, perhaps London landladies aren&rsquo;t all quite as black as they&rsquo;re
      usually painted.&rsquo; A conclusion which neither Edie nor Ernest had
      ever after any occasion for altering in any way.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; THE CLOUDS BEGIN TO BREAK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now, what were Ernest and Edie to do for a living! That was the
      practical difficulty that stared them at last plainly in the face&mdash;no
      mere abstract question of right and justice, of socialistic ideals or of
      political economy, but the stern, uncompromising, pressing domestic
      question of daily bread. They had come from Pilbury Regis with a very
      small reserve indeed in their poor lean little purses; and though Mrs.
      Halliss&rsquo;s lodgings might be cheap enough as London lodgings go,
      their means wouldn&rsquo;t allow them to stop there for many weeks
      together unless that hypothetical something of which they were in search
      should happen to turn up with most extraordinary and unprecedented
      rapidity. As soon as they were settled in at their tiny rooms, therefore,
      Ernest began a series of weary journeys into town, in search of work of
      some sort or another; and he hunted up all his old Oxford acquaintances in
      the Temple or elsewhere, to see if they could give him any suggestions
      towards a possible means of earning a livelihood. Most of them, he found
      to his surprise, though they had been great chums of his at college,
      seemed a little shy of him nowadays: one old Oxford friend, in particular,
      an impeccable man in close-cut frock coat and hat of shiny perfection, he
      overheard saying to another, he followed him accidentally up a long
      staircase in King&rsquo;s Bench Walk, &lsquo;Ah, yes, I met Le Breton in
      the Strand yesterday, when I was walking with a Q.C., too; he&rsquo;s
      married badly, got no employment, and looks awfully seedy. So very
      embarrassing, you know, now wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; And the other answered
      lightly, in the same unconcerned tone, &lsquo;Oh, of course, dreadfully
      embarrassing, really.&rsquo; Ernest slank down the staircase again with a
      sinking heart, and tried to get no further hints from the respectabilities
      of King&rsquo;s Bench Walk, at least in this his utmost extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night after night, as the dusk was beginning to throw its pall over the
      great lonely desert of London&mdash;one vast frigid expanse of living
      souls that knew and cared nothing about him&mdash;Ernest turned back,
      foot-sore and heart-sick, to the cheery little lodgings in the short
      side-street at Holloway. There good Mrs. Halliss, whose hard face seemed
      to grow softer the longer you looked at it, had a warm clip of tea always
      ready against his coming: and Edie, with wee Dot sleeping placidly on her
      arm, stood at the door to welcome him back again in wife-like fashion. The
      flowers in the window bloomed bright and gay in the tiny parlour: and
      Edie, with her motherly cares for little Dot, seemed more like herself
      than ever she had done before since poor Harry&rsquo;s death had clouded
      the morning of her happy lifetime. But to Ernest, even that pretty picture
      of the young mother and her sleeping baby looked only like one more
      reminder of the terrible burden he had unavoidably yet too lightly taken
      upon him. Those two dear lives depended wholly upon him for their daily
      bread, and where that daily bread was ever to come from he had absolutely
      not the slightest notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no place in which it is more utterly dreary to be quite
      friendless than in teeming London. Still, they were not absolutely
      friendless even in that great lurid throng of jarring humanity, all
      eagerly intent on its own business, and none of it troubling its
      collective head about two such nonentities as Ernest and Edie. Ronald used
      to come round daily to see them and cheer them up with his quiet
      confidence in the Disposer of all things: and Arthur Berkeley, neglecting
      his West End invitations and his lady admirers, used to drop in often of
      an evening for a friendly chat and a rational suggestion or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why don&rsquo;t you try journalism, Le Breton?&rsquo; he said to Ernest
      one night, as they sat discussing possibilities for the future in the
      little parlour together. &lsquo;Literature in some form or other&rsquo;s
      clearly the best thing for a man like you to turn his hand to. It demands
      less compliance with conventional rules than any other profession. No
      editor or publisher would ever dream of dismissing you, for example,
      because you invited your firebrand friend Max Schurz to dinner. On the
      contrary, if it comes to that, he&rsquo;d ask you what Herr Max thought
      about the future of trades unions and the socialist movement in Germany,
      and he&rsquo;d advise you to turn it into a column and a half of copy,
      with a large type sensational heading, &ldquo;A Communistic Leader
      Interviewed. From our Special Correspondent.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it&rsquo;s such a very useless, unsocialistic trade,&rsquo; Ernest
      answered doubtfully. &lsquo;Do you think it would be quite right, Arthur,
      for a man to try and earn money by it? Of course it isn&rsquo;t much worse
      than school-mastering, I dare say; nobody can say he&rsquo;s performing a
      very useful function for the world by hammering a few lines of Ovid into
      the skull of poor stupid Blenkinsopp major, who after all will only use
      what he calls his education, if he uses it in any way at all, to enable
      him to make rather more money than any other tobacco-pipe manufacturer in
      the entire trade. Still, one does feel for all that, that mere writing of
      books and papers is a very unsatisfactory kind of work for an ethical
      being to perform for humanity. How much better, now, if one could only be
      a farm-labourer or a shoemaker!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Berkeley looked across at him half angrily. &lsquo;My dear Ernest,&rsquo;
      he said, in a severer voice than he often used, &lsquo;the time has gone
      by now for this economical puritanism of yours. It won&rsquo;t do any
      longer. You have to think of your child and of Mrs. Le Breton. Your first
      duty is to earn a livelihood for them and yourself; when you&rsquo;ve done
      that satisfactorily, you may begin to think of the claims of humanity. Don&rsquo;t
      be vexed with me, my dear fellow, if I speak to you very plainly. You&rsquo;ve
      lost your place at Pilbury because you wouldn&rsquo;t be practical. You
      might have known they wouldn&rsquo;t let you go hobnobbing publicly before
      the very eyes of boys and parents with a firebrand German Socialist. Mind,
      I don&rsquo;t say anything against Herr Schurz myself&mdash;what little I
      know about him is all in his favour&mdash;that he&rsquo;s a thorn in the
      side of those odious prigs, the political economists. I&rsquo;ve often
      noticed that when a man wants to dogmatise to his heart&rsquo;s content
      without fear of contradiction, he invariably calls himself a political
      economist. Then if people differ from him, he smiles at them the benign
      smile of superior wisdom, and says superciliously, &ldquo;Ah, I see you
      don&rsquo;t understand political economy!&rdquo; Now, your Herr Schurz is
      a dissenter among economists, I believe&mdash;a sort of embryo Luther come
      to tilt with a German toy lance against their economical infallibilities;
      and I&rsquo;m told he knows more about the subject than all the rest of
      them put together. Of course, if you like him and respect him&mdash;and I
      know you have one superstition left, my dear fellow&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      reason on earth why you shouldn&rsquo;t do so; but you mustn&rsquo;t
      parade him too openly before the scandalised faces of respectable Pilbury.
      In future, you must be practical. Turn your hand to whatever you can get
      to do, and leave humanity at large to settle the debtor and creditor
      account with you hereafter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ll do my best, Berkeley,&rsquo; Ernest answered submissively;
      &lsquo;and if you like, I&rsquo;ll strangle my conscience and try my hand
      at journalism.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do, there&rsquo;s a good man,&rsquo; Arthur Berkeley said, delighted at
      his late conversion. &lsquo;I know two or three editor fellows pretty
      well, and if you&rsquo;ll only turn off something, I&rsquo;ll ask them to
      have a look at it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, at breakfast, Ernest discussed the possibilities of this new
      venture very seriously with sympathising Edie. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a great
      risk,&rsquo; he said, turning it over dubiously in his mind; &lsquo;a
      great risk, and a great expense too, for nothing certain. Let me see,
      there&rsquo;ll be a quire of white foolscap to start with; that&rsquo;ll
      be a shilling&mdash;a lot of money as things go at present, Edie, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why not begin with half a quire, Ernest?&rsquo; said his little wife,
      cautiously. &lsquo;That&rsquo;d be only sixpence, you see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do they halve quires at the stationer&rsquo;s, I wonder?&rsquo; Ernest
      went on still mentally reckoning. &lsquo;Well, suppose we put it at
      sixpence. Then we&rsquo;ve got pens already by us, but not any ink&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a penny&mdash;and there&rsquo;s postage, say about twopence; total
      ninepence. That&rsquo;s a lot of money, isn&rsquo;t it, now, for a pure
      uncertainty?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;d try it, Ernest dear, if I were you,&rsquo; Edie answered.
      &lsquo;We must do something, mustn&rsquo;t we, dear, to earn our living.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We must,&rsquo; Ernest said, sighing. &lsquo;I wish it were anything but
      that; but I suppose what must be must be. Well, I&rsquo;ll go out a walk
      by myself in the quietest streets I can find, and try if I can think of
      anything on earth a man can write about. Arthur Berkeley says I ought to
      begin with a social article for a paper; he knows the &ldquo;Morning
      Intelligence&rdquo; people, and he&rsquo;ll try to get them to take
      something if I can manage to write it. I wonder what on earth would do as
      a social article for the &ldquo;Morning Intelligence&rdquo;! If only they&rsquo;d
      let me write about socialism now! but Arthur says they won&rsquo;t take
      that; the times aren&rsquo;t yet ripe for it. I wish they were, Edie, I
      wish they were; and then perhaps you and I would find some way to earn
      ourselves a decent living.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ernest went out, and ruminated quietly by himself, as well as he was
      able, in the least frequented streets of Holloway and Highgate. After
      about half an hour&rsquo;s excogitation, a brilliant idea at last flashed
      across him; he had found in a tobacconist&rsquo;s window something to
      write about! Your practised journalist doesn&rsquo;t need to think at all;
      he writes whatever comes uppermost without the unnecessarily troublesome
      preliminary of deliberate thinking. But Ernest Le Breton was only making
      his first experiment in the queer craft, and he looked upon himself as a
      veritable Watt or Columbus when he had actually discovered that hitherto
      unknown object, a thing to write about. He went straight back to good Mrs.
      Halliss&rsquo;s with his discovery whirling in his head, stopping only by
      the way at the stationer&rsquo;s, to invest in half a quire of white
      foolscap. &lsquo;The best&rsquo;s a shilling a quire, mister,&rsquo; said
      the shopman; &lsquo;second best, tenpence.&rsquo; Communist as he was,
      Ernest couldn&rsquo;t help noticing the unusual mode of address; but he
      took the cheaper quality quietly, and congratulated himself on his good
      luck in saving a penny upon the original estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got home, he sat down at the plain wooden table by the window, and
      began with nervous haste to write away rapidly at his first literary
      venture. Edie sat by in her little low chair and watched him closely with
      breathless interest. Would it be a success or a failure? That was the
      question they were both every moment intently asking themselves. It was
      not a very important piece of literary workmanship, to be sure; only a
      social leader for a newspaper, to be carelessly skimmed to-day and used to
      light the fire to-morrow, if even that; and yet had it been the greatest
      masterpiece ever produced by the human intellect Ernest could not have
      worked at it with more conscientious care, or Edie watched him with
      profounder admiration. When Shakespeare sat down to write ‘Hamlet,&rsquo;
      it may be confidently asserted that neither Mistress Anne Shakespeare nor
      anybody else awaited the result of his literary labours with such
      unbounded and feverish anxiety. By the time Ernest had finished his second
      sheet of white foolscap&mdash;much erased and interlined with interminable
      additions and corrections&mdash;Edie ventured for a moment briefly to
      interrupt his creative efforts. ‘Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve
      written as much as makes an ordinary leader now, Ernest?&rsquo; she asked,
      apologetically. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re making it a good deal
      longer than it ought to be by rights.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, Edie,&rsquo; Ernest answered, gazing
      at the two laboured sheets with infinite dubitation and searching of
      spirit. ‘I suppose one ought properly to count the words in an average
      leader, and make it the same length as they always are in the &ldquo;Morning
      Intelligence.&rdquo; I think they generally run to just a column.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course you ought, dear,&rsquo; Edie answered. &lsquo;Run out this
      minute and buy one before you go a single line further.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest looked back at his two pages of foolscap somewhat ruefully. ‘That&rsquo;s
      a dreadful bore,&rsquo; he said, with a sigh: &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll just run
      away with the whole penny I thought I&rsquo;d managed to save in getting
      the second quality of foolscap for fivepence. However, I suppose it can&rsquo;t
      be helped, and after all, if the thing succeeds, one can look upon the
      penny in the light of an investment. It&rsquo;s throwing a sprat to catch
      a whale, as the proverb says: though I&rsquo;m afraid Herr Max would say
      that that was a very immoral capitalist proverb. How horribly low we must
      be sinking, Edie, when we come to use the anti-social language of those
      dreadful capitalists!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t think capitalists deal much in proverbs, dear,&rsquo; said
      Edie, smiling in spite of herself; &lsquo;but you needn&rsquo;t go to the
      expense of buying a &ldquo;Morning Intelligence,&rdquo; I dare say, for
      perhaps Mrs. Halliss may have an old one in the house; or if not, she
      might be able to borrow one from a neighbour. She has a perfect genius for
      borrowing, Mrs. Halliss; she borrows everything I want from somebody or
      other. I&rsquo;ll just run down to the kitchen this minute and ask her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few seconds Edie returned in triumph with an old soiled and torn copy
      of the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence,&rsquo; duly procured by the ingenious
      Mrs. Halliss from the dairy opposite. It was a decidedly antiquated copy,
      and it had only too obviously been employed by its late possessor to wrap
      up a couple of kippered herrings; but it was still entire, so far as
      regarded the leaders at least, and it was perfectly legible in spite of
      its ancient and fish-like smell. To ensure accuracy, Ernest and Edie took
      a leader apiece, and carefully counted up the number of words that went to
      the column. They came on an average to fifteen hundred. Then Ernest
      counted his own manuscript with equal care&mdash;no easy task when one
      took into consideration the interlined or erased passages&mdash;and, to
      his infinite disgust, discovered that it only extended to seven hundred
      and fifty words. &lsquo;Why, Edie,&rsquo; he said, in a very disappointed
      tone, &lsquo;how little it prints into! I should certainly have thought I&rsquo;d
      written at least a whole column. And the worst of it is, I believe I&rsquo;ve
      really said all I have to say about the subject.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is it, Ernest dear?&rsquo; asked Edie.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Italian organ-boys,&rsquo; Ernest answered. &lsquo;I saw on a placard in
      the news shop that one of them had been taken to a hospital in a starving
      condition.&rsquo; He hardly liked to tell even Edie that he had stood for
      ten minutes at a tobacconist&rsquo;s window and read the case in a sheet
      of &lsquo;Lloyd&rsquo;s News&rsquo; conspicuously hung up there for public
      perusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, let me hear what you have written, Ernest dear, and then see if you
      couldn&rsquo;t expand it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest read it over most seriously and solemnly&mdash;it was only a social
      leader, of the ordinary commonplace talky-talky sort; but to those two
      poor young people it was a very serious and solemn matter indeed&mdash;no
      less a matter than their own two lives and little Dot&rsquo;s into the
      bargain. It began with the particular case of the particular organ-boy who
      formed the peg on which the whole article was to be hung; it went on to
      discourse on the lives and manners of organ-boys in general; it digressed
      into the natural history of the common guinea-pig, with an excursus on the
      scenery of the Lower Apennines; and it finished off with sundry abstract
      observations on the musical aspect of the barrel-organ and the aesthetic
      value of hurdygurdy performances. Edie listened to it all with deep
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s very good, Ernest dear,&rsquo; she said, with wifely
      admiration, as soon as he had finished. &lsquo;Just like a real leader
      exactly; only, do you know, there aren&rsquo;t any anecdotes in it. I
      think a social leader of that sort ought always to have a lot of
      anecdotes. Couldn&rsquo;t you manage to bring in something about Fox and
      Sheridan, or about George IV. and Beau Brummel? They always do, you know,
      in most of the papers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest gazed at her in silent admiration. &lsquo;How clever of you, Edie,&rsquo;
      he said, &lsquo;to think of that! Why, of course there ought to be some
      anecdotes. They&rsquo;re the very breath of life to this sort of
      meaningless writing. Only, somehow, George IV. and Beau Brummel don&rsquo;t
      seem exactly relevant to Italian organ-grinders, now do they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thought,&rsquo; said Edie, with hardly a touch of unintentional satire,
      ‘that the best thing about anecdotes of that kind in a newspaper was their
      utter irrelevancy. But if Beau Brummel won&rsquo;t do, couldn&rsquo;t you
      manage to work in Guicciardini and the galleys? That&rsquo;s strictly
      Italian, you know, and therefore relevant; and I&rsquo;m sure the
      newspaper leaders are extremely fond of that story about Guiccardini.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They are,&rsquo; Ernest answered,'most undoubtedly; but perhaps for that
      very reason readers may be beginning to get just a little tired of it by
      this time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t think the readers matter much,&rsquo; said Edie, with a
      brilliant, flash of practical common-sense; &lsquo;at least, not nearly
      half as much, Ernest, as the editor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite true,&rsquo; Ernest replied, with another admiring look; &lsquo;but
      probably the editor more or less consults the taste and feelings of the
      readers. Well, I&rsquo;ll try to expand it a bit, and I&rsquo;ll manage to
      drag in an anecdote or two somehow&mdash;if not Guicciardini, at least
      something or other else Italian. You see Italy&rsquo;s a tolerably rich
      subject, because you can do any amount about Raffael, and Michael Angelo,
      and Leonardo, and so forth, not to mention Botticelli. The papers have
      made a dreadful run lately on Botticelli.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ernest sat down once more at the table by the window, and began to
      interlard the manuscript with such allusions to Italy and the Italians as
      could suggest themselves on the spur of the moment to his anxious
      imagination. At the end of half an hour&mdash;about the time a practised
      hand would have occupied in writing the whole article&mdash;he counted
      words once more, and found there were still two hundred wanting. Two
      hundred more words to say about Italian organ-boys! Alas for the untrained
      human fancy! A master leader writer at the office of the &lsquo;Morning
      Intelligence&rsquo; could have run on for ever on so fertile and
      suggestive a theme&mdash;a theme pregnant with unlimited openings for all
      the cheap commonplaces of abstract journalistic philanthropy; but poor
      Ernest, a &lsquo;prentice hand at the trade, had yet to learn the fluent
      trick of the accomplished news purveyor; he absolutely could not write
      without thinking about it. A third time he was obliged to recommit his
      manuscript, and a third time to count the words over. This time, oh joy,
      the reckoning came out as close as possible to the even fifteen hundred.
      Ernest gave a sigh of relief, and turned to read it all over again, as
      finally enlarged and amended, to the critical ears of admiring Edie.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was anecdote enough now, in all conscience, in the article; and
      allusions enough to stock a whole week&rsquo;s numbers of the &lsquo;Morning
      Intelligence.&rsquo; Edie listened to the whole tirade with an air of the
      most severe and impartial criticism. When Ernest had finished, she rose up
      and kissed him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll do, Ernest,&rsquo; she
      said confidently. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s exactly like a real leader. It&rsquo;s
      quite beautiful&mdash;a great deal more beautiful, in fact, than anything
      else I ever read in a newspaper: it&rsquo;s good enough to print in a
      volume.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope the editor&rsquo;ll think so,&rsquo; Ernest answered, dubiously.
      &lsquo;If not, what a lot of valuable tenpenny foolscap wasted all for
      nothing! Now I must write it all out again clean, Edie, on fresh pieces.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Newspaper men, it must be candidly admitted, do not usually write their
      articles twice over; indeed, to judge by the result, it may be charitably
      believed that they do not even, as a rule, read them through when written,
      to correct their frequent accidental slips of logic or English; but Ernest
      wrote out his organ-boy leader in his most legible and roundest hand,
      copperplate fashion, with as much care and precision as if it were his
      first copy for presentation to the stern writing-master of a Draconian
      board school. &lsquo;Editors are more likely to read your manuscript if it&rsquo;s
      legible, I should think, Edie,&rsquo; he said, looking up at her with more
      of hope in his face than had often been seen in it of late. &lsquo;I
      wonder, now, whether they prefer it sent in a long envelope, folded in
      three; or in a square envelope, folded twice over; or in a paper cover,
      open like a pamphlet. There must be some recognised professional way of
      doing it, and I should think one&rsquo;s more likely to get it taken if
      one sends it in the regular professional fashion, than if one makes it
      look too amateurish. I shall go in for the long envelope; at any rate, if
      not journalistic, it&rsquo;s at least official.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor of the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence&rsquo; is an important
      personage in contemporary politics, and a man of more real weight in the
      world than half-a-dozen Members of Parliament for obscure country
      boroughs; but even that mighty man himself would probably have been a
      little surprised as well as amused (if he could have seen it) at the way
      in which Ernest and Edie Le Breton anxiously endeavoured to conciliate
      beforehand his merest possible personal fads and fancies. As a matter of
      fact, the question of the particular paper on which the article was
      written mattered to him absolutely less than nothing, inasmuch as he never
      looked at anything whatsoever until it had been set up in type for him to
      pass off-hand judgment upon its faults or its merits. His time was far too
      valuable to be lightly wasted on the task of deciphering crabbed
      manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, Berkeley called to see whether Ernest had followed his
      suggestion, and was agreeably surprised to find a whole article already
      finished. He glanced through the neatly written pages, and was still more
      pleased to discover that Ernest, with an unsuspected outburst of
      practicality and practicability, had really hit upon a possible subject.
      &lsquo;This may do, Ernest,&rsquo; he said with a sigh of relief. &lsquo;I
      dare say it will. I know Lancaster wants leader writers, and I think this
      is quite good enough to serve his turn. I&rsquo;ve spoken to him about
      you: come round with me now&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be at the office by four o&rsquo;clock&mdash;and
      we&rsquo;ll see what we can do for you. It&rsquo;s absolutely useless
      sending anything to the editor of a daily paper without an introduction.
      You might write with the pen of the angel Gabriel, or turn out leaders
      which were a judicious mean between Gladstone, Burke, and Herbert Spencer,
      and it would profit you nothing, for the simple reason that he hasn&rsquo;t
      got the time to read them. He would toss Junius and Montesquieu into the
      waste paper basket, and accept copy on the shocking murder in the Borough
      Road from one of his regular contributors instead. He can&rsquo;t help
      himself: and what you must do, Ernest, is to become one of the regular
      ring, and combine to keep Junius and Montesquieu permanently outside.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The struggle for existence gives no quarter,&rsquo; Ernest said sadly
      with half a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And takes none,&rsquo; Berkeley answered quickly. &lsquo;So for your wife&rsquo;s
      sake you must try your best to fight your way through it on your own
      account, for yourself and your family.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor of the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence,&rsquo; Mr. Hugh Lancaster,
      was a short, thick-set, hard-headed sort of man, with a kindly twinkle in
      his keen grey eyes, and a harassed smile playing continually around the
      corners of his firm and dose mouth. He looked as though he was naturally a
      good-humoured benevolent person, overdriven at the journalistic mill till
      half the life was worn out of him, leaving the benevolence as a wearied
      remnant, without energy enough to express itself in any other fashion than
      by the perpetual harassed smile. He saw Arthur Berkeley and Ernest Le
      Breton at once in his own sanctum, and took the manuscript from their
      hands with a languid air of perfect resignation. &lsquo;This is the friend
      you spoke of, is it, Berkeley?&rsquo; he said in a wearied way. &lsquo;Well,
      well, we&rsquo;ll see what we can do for him.&rsquo; At the same time he
      rang a tiny hand-bell. A boy, rather the worse for printer&rsquo;s ink,
      appeared at the summons. Mr. Lancaster handed him Ernest&rsquo;s careful
      manuscript unopened, with the laconic order, &lsquo;Press. Proof
      immediately.&rsquo; The boy took it without a word. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very
      busy now,&rsquo; Mr. Lancaster went on in the same wearied dispirited
      manner: &lsquo;come again in thirty-five minutes. Jones, show these
      gentlemen into a room somewhere.&rsquo; And the editor fell back forthwith
      into his easy-chair and his original attitude of listless indifference.
      Berkeley and Ernest followed the boy into a bare back room, furnished only
      with a deal table and two chairs, and there anxiously awaited the result
      of the editor&rsquo;s critical examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don&rsquo;t be afraid of Lancaster, Ernest,&rsquo; Arthur said kindly.
      &lsquo;His manner&rsquo;s awfully cold, I know, but he means well, and I
      really believe he&rsquo;d go out of his way, rather than not, to do a
      kindness for anybody he thought actually in want of occupation. With most
      men, that&rsquo;s an excellent reason for not employing you: with
      Lancaster I do truly think it&rsquo;s a genuine recommendation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of thirty-five minutes the grimy-faced office-boy returned with
      a friendly nod. &lsquo;Editor&rsquo;ll see you,&rsquo; he said, with the
      Spartan brevity of the journalistic world&mdash;nobody connected with
      newspapers ever writes or speaks a single word unnecessarily, if he isn&rsquo;t
      going to be paid for it at so much per thousand&mdash;and Ernest followed
      him, trembling from head to foot, into Mr. Lancaster&rsquo;s private
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great editor took up the steaming hot proof that had just been brought
      him, and glanced down it carelessly with a rapid scrutiny. Then he turned
      to Ernest, and said in a dreamy fashion, &lsquo;This will do. We&rsquo;ll
      print this to-morrow. You may send us a middle very occasionally. Come
      here at four o&rsquo;clock, when a subject suggests itself to you, and
      speak to me about it. My time&rsquo;s very fully occupied. Good morning,
      Mr. Le Breton. Berkeley, stop a minute, I want to talk with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all done in a moment, and almost before Ernest knew what had
      happened he was out in the street again, with tears filling his eyes, and
      joy his heart, for here at last was bread, bread, bread, for Edie and the
      baby! He ran without stopping all the way back to Holloway, rushed
      headlong into the house and fell into Edie&rsquo;s arms, calling out
      wildly, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s taken it! He&rsquo;s taken it!&rsquo; Edie
      kissed him half-a-dozen times over, and answered bravely, &lsquo;I knew he
      would, Ernest. It was such a splendid article.&rsquo; And yet thousands of
      readers of the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence&rsquo; next day skimmed lightly
      over the leader on organ-boys in their ordinary casual fashion, without
      even thinking what hopes and fears and doubts and terrors had gone to the
      making of that very commonplace bit of newspaper rhetoric. For if the
      truth must be told, Edie&rsquo;s first admiring criticism was perfectly
      correct, and Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s leader was just for all the world
      exactly the same as anybody else&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Arthur Berkeley had stayed behind as requested in Mr. Lancaster&rsquo;s
      study, and waited to hear what Mr. Lancaster had to say to him. The editor
      looked up at him wearily from his chair, passed his bread hand slowly
      across his bewildered forehead, and then said the one word, &lsquo;Poor?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing on earth to do,&rsquo; Berkeley answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He might make a journalist, perhaps,&rsquo; the editor said, sleepily.
      ‘This social&rsquo;s up to the average. At any rate, I&rsquo;ll do my very
      best for him. But he can&rsquo;t live upon socials. We have too many
      social men already. What can he do? That&rsquo;s the question. It won&rsquo;t
      do to say he can write pretty nearly as well about anything that turns up
      as any other man in England can do. I can get a hundred young fellows in
      the Temple to do that, any day. The real question&rsquo;s this: is there
      anything he can write about a great deal better than all the other men in
      all England put together?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, there is,&rsquo; Berkeley answered with commendable promptitude,
      undismayed by Mr. Lancaster&rsquo;s excessive requirements. &lsquo;He
      knows more about communists, socialists, and political exiles generally,
      than anybody else in the whole of London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good,&rsquo; the editor answered, brightening up, and speaking for a
      moment a little less languidly. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good. There&rsquo;s
      this man Schurz, now, the German agitator. He&rsquo;s going to be tried
      soon for a seditious libel it seems, and he&rsquo;ll be sent to prison,
      naturally. Now, does your friend know anything at all of this fellow?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He knows him personally and intimately,&rsquo; Berkeley replied,
      delighted to find that the card which had proved so bad a one at Pilbury
      Regis was turning up trumps in the more Bohemian neighbourhood of the
      Temple and Fleet Street. &lsquo;He can give you any information you want
      about Schurz or any of the rest of those people. He has associated with
      them all familiarly for the last six or seven years.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then he takes an interest in politics,&rsquo; said Mr. Lancaster, almost
      waking up now. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good again. It&rsquo;s so very
      difficult to find young men nowadays, able to write, who take a genuine
      interest in politics. They all go off after literature and science and
      aesthetics, and other dry uninteresting subjects. Now, what does your
      average intelligent daily paper reader care, I should like to know, about
      literature and science and aesthetics and so forth? Well, he&rsquo;ll do,
      I&rsquo;ve very little doubt: at any rate, I&rsquo;ll give him a trial.
      Perhaps he might be able to undertake this Great Widgerly disenfranchising
      case. Stop! he&rsquo;s poor, isn&rsquo;t he? I daresay he&rsquo;d just as
      soon not wait for his money for this social. In the ordinary course, he
      wouldn&rsquo;t get paid till the end of the quarter; but I&rsquo;ll give
      you a cheque to take back to him now; perhaps he wants it. Poor fellow,
      poor fellow! he really looks very delicate. Depend upon it, Berkeley, I&rsquo;ll
      do anything on earth for him, if only he&rsquo;ll write tolerably.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re awfully good,&rsquo; Arthur said, taking the proffered
      cheque gratefully. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure the money will be of great use to
      him: and it&rsquo;s very kind indeed of you to have thought of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all, not at all,'the editor answered, collapsing dreamily. ‘Good
      morning, good morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Mrs. Halliss&rsquo;s lodgings in Holloway, Edie was just saying to
      Ernest over their simple tea, &lsquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;ll give you
      for it, Ernest.&rsquo; And Ernest had just answered, big with hope,
      &lsquo;Well, I should think it would be quite ten shillings, but I shouldn&rsquo;t
      be surprised, Edie, if it was as much as a pound;&rsquo; when the door
      opened, and in walked Arthur Berkeley, with a cheque in his hand, which he
      laid by Edie&rsquo;s teacup. Edie took it up and gave a little cry of
      delight and astonishment. Ernest caught it from her hand in his eagerness,
      and gazed upon it with dazed and swimming vision. Did he read the words
      aright, and could it be really, &lsquo;Pay E. Le Breton, Esq., or order,
      three guineas&rsquo;? Three guineas! Three guineas! Three real actual
      positive gold and silver guineas! It was almost too much for either of
      them to believe, and all for a single morning&rsquo;s light labour! What a
      perfect Eldorado of wealth and happiness seemed now to be opening out
      unexpectedly before them!
    </p>
    <p>
      So much Arthur Berkeley, his own eyes glistening too with a sympathetic
      moisture, saw and heard before he went away in a happier mood and left
      them to their own domestic congratulations. But he did not see or know the
      reaction that came in the dead of night, after all that day&rsquo;s
      unwonted excitement, to poor, sickening, weary, over-burdened Ernest. Even
      Edie never knew it all, for Ernest was careful to hide it as much as
      possible from her knowledge. But he knew himself, though he would not even
      light the candle to see it, that he had got those three glorious guineas&mdash;the
      guineas they had so delighted in&mdash;with something more than a morning&rsquo;s
      labour. He had had to pay for them, not figuratively but literally, with
      some of his very life-blood.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; HARD PRESSED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week or two later, while &lsquo;The Primate of Fiji&rsquo; was still
      running vigorously at the Ambiguities Theatre, Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s
      second opera, &lsquo;The Duke of Bermondsey; or, the Bold Buccaneers of
      the Isle of Dogs,&rsquo; was brought out with vast success and immense
      exultation at the Marlborough. There is always a strong tendency to
      criticise a little severely the second work of a successful beginner:
      people like to assume a knowing air, and to murmur self-complacently that
      they felt sure from the beginning he couldn&rsquo;t keep up permanently to
      his first level. But in spite of that natural tendency of the unregenerate
      human mind, and in spite, too, of a marked political bias on the author&rsquo;s
      part, &lsquo;The Duke of Bermondsey&rsquo; took the town by storm almost
      as completely as &lsquo;The Primate of Fiji&rsquo; had done before it.
      Everybody said that though the principles of the piece were really quite
      atrocious, when one came to think of them seriously, yet the music and the
      dialogue were crisp and brisk enough to float any amount of social or
      economical heresy that that clever young man, Mr. Arthur Berkeley, might
      choose to put into one of his amusing and original operas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social and economical heresies, of course, were partly due to Ernest
      Le Breton&rsquo;s insidious influence. At the same time that Berkeley was
      engaged in partially converting Ernest, Ernest was engaged in the counter
      process of partially converting Berkeley. To say the truth, the conversion
      was not a very difficult matter to effect; the neophyte had in him
      implicitly already the chief saving doctrines of the socialistic faith,
      or, if one must put it conversely, the germs of the disease were
      constitutionally implanted in his system, and only needed a little
      external encouragement to bring the poison out fully in the most virulent
      form of the complaint. The great point of &lsquo;The Duke of Bermondsey&rsquo;
      consisted in the ridiculous contrast it exhibited between the wealth,
      dignity, and self-importance of the duke himself, and the squalid,
      miserable, shrinking poverty of the East-end purlieus from which he drew
      his enormous revenues. Ernest knew a little about the East-end from
      practical experience; he had gone there often with Ronald, on his rounds
      of mercy, and had seen with his own eyes those dens of misery which most
      people have only heard or read about. It was Ernest who had suggested this
      light satirical treatment of the great social problem, whose more serious
      side he himself had learnt to look at in Max Schurz&rsquo;s revolutionary
      salon; and it was to Ernest that Arthur Berkeley owed the first hint of
      that famous scene where the young Countess of Coalbrookdale converses
      familiarly on the natural beauties of healthful labour with the chorus of
      intelligent colliery hands, in the most realistic of grimy costumes, from
      her father&rsquo;s estates in Staffordshire. The stalls hardly knew
      whether to laugh or frown when the intelligent colliers respectfully
      invited the countess, in her best Ascot flounces and furbelows, to enjoy
      the lauded delights of healthful mine labour in propriâ personâ: but they
      quite recovered their good humour when the band of theatrical buccaneers,
      got up by the duke in Spanish costumes, with intent to deceive his lawless
      tenants in the East-end, came unexpectedly face to face with the genuine
      buccaneers of the Isle of Dogs, clothed in real costermonger caps and
      second-hand pilot-jackets of the marine-storedealers&rsquo; fashionable
      pattern. It was all only the ridiculous incongruity of our actual society
      represented in the very faintest shades of caricature upon the stage; but
      it made the incongruities more incongruous still to see them crowded
      together so closely in a single concentrated tableau. Unthinking people
      laughed uproariously at the fun and nonsense of the piece; thinking people
      laughed too, but not without an uncomfortable side twinge of conscientious
      remorse at the pity of it all. Some wise heads even observed with a shrug
      that when this sort of thing was applauded upon the stage, the fine old
      institutions of England were getting into dangerous contact with these
      pernicious continental socialistic theories. And no doubt those good
      people were really wise in their generation. &lsquo;When Figaro came,&rsquo;
      Arthur Berkeley said himself to Ernest, &lsquo;the French revolution wasn&rsquo;t
      many paces behind on the track of the ages.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Better even than the Primate, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; said Hilda Tregellis,
      as she met him in a London drawing-room a few days later. &lsquo;What a
      delightful scene, that of the Countess of Coalbrookdale! You&rsquo;re
      doing real good, I do believe, by making people think about these things
      more seriously, you know. As poor dear Mr. Le Breton would have said, you&rsquo;ve
      got an ethical purpose&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the word?&mdash;underlying
      even your comic operas. By the way, do you ever see the Le Bretons now?
      Poor souls, I hear they&rsquo;re doing very badly. The elder brother,
      Herbert Le Breton&mdash;horrid wretch!&mdash;he&rsquo;s here to-night;
      going to marry that pretty Miss Faucit, they say; daughter of old Mr.
      Faucit, the candle-maker&mdash;no, not candles, soap I think it is&mdash;but
      it doesn&rsquo;t matter twopence nowadays, does it? Well, as I was saying,
      you&rsquo;re doing a great deal of good with characters like this Countess
      of Coalbrookdale. We want more mixture of classes, don&rsquo;t we? more
      free intercourse between them; more familiarity of every sort. For my
      part, now, I should really very much like to know more of the inner life
      of the working classes.&rsquo; ‘If only he&rsquo;d ask me to go to lunch,&rsquo;
      she thought, &lsquo;with his dear old father, the superannuated shoemaker!
      so very romantic, really!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur only smiled a sphinx-like smile, and answered lightly, ‘You
      would probably object to their treatment of you as much as the countess
      objected to the uupleasant griminess of the too-realistic coal galleries.
      Suppose you were to fall into the hands of a logical old radical workman,
      for example, who tore you to pieces, mentally speaking, with a shake or
      two of his big teeth, and calmly informed you that in his opinion you were
      nothing more than a very empty-headed, pretentious, ignorant young woman&mdash;perhaps
      even, after the plain-spoken vocabulary of hie kind, a regular downright
      minx and hussey?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Charming,&rsquo; Lady Hilda answered, with perfect candour; &lsquo;so
      very different from the senseless adulation of all the Hughs, and Guys,
      and Berties! What I do love in talking to clever men, Mr. Berkeley, is
      their delicious frankness and transparency. If they think one a fool, they
      tell one so plainly, or at least they let one see it without any reserve.
      Now that, you know, is really such a very delightful trait in clever
      people&rsquo;s characters!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t know how you can have had the opportunity of judging, Lady
      Hilda,&rsquo; Arthur answered, looking at her handsome open face with a
      momentary glance of passing admiration&mdash;Hilda Tregellis was improving
      visibly as she matured&mdash;&lsquo;for no one can possibly ever have
      thought anything of the sort with you, I&rsquo;m certain: and that I can
      say quite candidly, without the slightest tinge of flattery or adulation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What! YOU don&rsquo;t think me a fool, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; cried Lady
      Hilda, delighted even with that very negative bit of favourable
      appreciation. ‘Now, that I call a real compliment, I assure you, because I
      know you clever people pitch your standard of intelligence so very, very
      high! You consider everybody fools, I&rsquo;m sure, except the few people
      who are almost as clever as you yourselves are. However, to return to the
      countess: I do think there ought to be more mixture of classes in England,
      and somebody told me&rsquo;&mdash;this was a violent effort to be literary
      on Hilda&rsquo;s part, by way of rising to the height of the occasion&mdash;&lsquo;somebody
      told me that Mr. Matthew Arnold, who&rsquo;s so dreadfully satirical, and
      cultivated, and so forth, thinks exactly the same thing, you know. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t the Countess of Coalbrookdale have really married the
      foreman of the colliers? I daresay she&rsquo;d have been a great deal
      happier with a kind-hearted sensible man like him than with that
      lumbering, hunting, pheasant-shooting, horse-racing lout of a Lord
      Coalbrookdale, who would go to Norway on a fishing tour without her&mdash;now
      wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very probably,&rsquo; Berkeley answered: &lsquo;but in these matters we
      don&rsquo;t regard happiness only,&mdash;that, you see, would be mere
      base, vulgar, commonplace utilitarianism:&mdash;we regard much more that
      grand impersonal overruling entity, that unseen code of social morals,
      which we commonly call the CONVENANCES. Proper people don&rsquo;t take
      happiness into consideration at all, comparatively: they act religiously
      after the fashion that the CONVENANCES impose upon them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, but why, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; Lady Hilda said, vehemently, &lsquo;why
      should the whole world always take it for granted that because a girl
      happens to be born the daughter of people whose name&rsquo;s in the
      peerage, she must necessarily be the slave of the proprieties, devoid of
      all higher or better instincts? Why should they take it for granted that
      she&rsquo;s destitute of any appreciation for any kind of greatness except
      the kind that&rsquo;s represented by a million and a quarter in the three
      per cents., or a great-great-grandfather who fought at the battle of
      Naseby? Why mayn&rsquo;t she have a spark of originality? Why mayn&rsquo;t
      she be as much attracted by literature, by science, by art, by... by... by
      beautiful music, as, say, the daughter of a lawyer, a doctor, or, or, or a
      country shopkeeper? What I want to know is just this, Mr. Berkeley: if
      people don&rsquo;t believe in distinctions of birth, why on earth should
      they suppose that Lady Mary, or Lady Betty, or Lady Winifred, must
      necessarily be more banale and vulgar-minded, and common-place than plain
      Miss Jones, or Miss Brown, or Miss Robinson? You admit that these other
      girls may possibly care for higher subjects: then why on earth shouldn&rsquo;t
      we, can you tell me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Certainly,&rsquo; Arthur Berkeley answered, looking down into Lady Hilda&rsquo;s
      beautiful eyes after a dreamy fashion, &lsquo;certainly there&rsquo;s no
      inherent reason why one person shouldn&rsquo;t have just as high tastes by
      nature as another. Everything depends, I suppose, upon inherited
      qualities, variously mixed, and afterwards modified by society and
      education.&mdash;It&rsquo;s very hot here, to-night, Lady Hilda, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very,&rsquo; Lady Hilda echoed, taking his arm as she spoke. &lsquo;Shall
      we go into the conservatory?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was just going to propose it myself,&rsquo; Berkeley said, with a faint
      tremor thrilling in his voice. She was a very beautiful woman, certainly,
      and her unfeigned appreciation of his plays and his music was undeniably
      very flattering to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Unless I bring him fairly to book this evening,&rsquo; Hilda thought to
      herself as she swept with him gracefully into the conservatory, &lsquo;I
      shall have to fall back upon the red-haired hurlyburlying Scotch
      professor, after all&mdash;if I don&rsquo;t want to end by getting into
      the clutches of one of those horrid Monties or Algies!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; IRRECLAIMABLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The occasional social articles for the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence&rsquo;
      supplied Ernest with work enough for the time being to occupy part of his
      leisure, and income enough to keep the ship floating somehow, if not
      securely, at least in decent fair-weather fashion. His frequent trips with
      Ronald into the East-end gave him something comparatively fresh to write
      about, and though he was compelled to conceal his own sentiments upon many
      points, in order to conform to that impersonal conscience, &lsquo;the
      policy of the paper,&rsquo; he was still able to deal with subjects that
      really interested him, and in which he fancied he might actually be doing
      a little good. A few days after he had taken seriously to the new
      occupation, good Mrs. Halliss made her appearance in the tiny sitting-room
      one morning, and with many apologies and much humming and hawing ventured
      to make a slight personal representation to wondering little Edie.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you please, mum,&rsquo; she said nervously, fumbling all the while
      with the corner of the table cloth she was folding on the breakfast-table,
      ‘if I might make so bold, mum, without offence, I should like to say as me
      an&rsquo; John &lsquo;as been talkin&rsquo; it hover, an&rsquo; we think
      now as your good gentleman &lsquo;as so much writin&rsquo; to do, at
      &lsquo;is littery work, mum, as I may make bold to call it, perhaps you
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind, so as not to disturb &lsquo;im with the blessed baby&mdash;not
      as that dear child couldn&rsquo;t never disturb nobody, bless &lsquo;er
      dear &lsquo;eart, the darling, not even when she&rsquo;s cryin&rsquo;, she&rsquo;s
      that sweet and gentle,&mdash;but we thought, mum, as littery gentlemen
      likes to &lsquo;ave the coast clear, in the manner of speakin&rsquo;, and
      perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind bein&rsquo; so good as to use the little
      front room upstairs, mum, for a sort o&rsquo; nursery, as I may call it,
      for the dear baby. It was our bedroom, that was, where John an&rsquo; me
      used to sleep; but we&rsquo;ve been an&rsquo; putt our things into the
      front hattic, mum, as is very nice and comfortable in every way, so as to
      make room for the dear baby. An&rsquo; if you won&rsquo;t take it as a
      liberty, mum, me an&rsquo; John &lsquo;ud be more&rsquo;n glad if you&rsquo;d
      kindly make use of that there room for a sort of occasional nursery for
      the dear baby.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie bit her lip hard in her momentary confusion. &lsquo;Oh, dear, Mrs.
      Halliss,&rsquo; she said, almost crying at the kindly meant offer, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid we can&rsquo;t afford to have THREE rooms all for ourselves as
      things go at present. How much do you propose to charge us for the
      additional nursery?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Charge you for it, mum,&rsquo; Mrs. Halliss echoed, almost indignantly;
      ‘charge our lodgers for any little hextry accommodation like the small
      front room upstairs, mum&mdash;now, don&rsquo;t you go and say that to
      John, mum, I beg of you; for &lsquo;is temper&rsquo;s rather short at
      times, mum, thro&rsquo; boin&rsquo; asmatic and the rheumatiz, though you
      wouldn&rsquo;t think it to look at &lsquo;im, that you wouldn&rsquo;t; an&rsquo;
      I&rsquo;m reely afraid, mum, he might get angry if anybody was to holler
      &lsquo;im anythink for a little bit of hextry accommodation like that
      there. Lord bless your dear &lsquo;eart, mum, don&rsquo;t you say nothink
      more about that, I beg of you; for if John was to &lsquo;ear of it, he&rsquo;d
      go off in a downright tearin&rsquo; tantrum at the bare notion. An&rsquo;
      about dinner, mum, you&rsquo;ll ‘ave the cold mutton an&rsquo; potatoes,
      and a bit of biled beetroot; and I&rsquo;ll just run round to the
      greengrocer&rsquo;s this moment to order it for early dinner.&rsquo; And
      before Edie had time to thank her, the good woman was out of tha room
      again, and down in the kitchen at her daily preparations, with tears
      trickling slowly down both her hard red cheeks in her own motherly
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      So from that time forth, Ernest had the small sitting-room entirely to
      himself, whenever he was engaged in his literary labours, while Edie and
      Dot turned the front bedroom on the first floor into a neat and commodious
      nursery. As other work did not turn up so rapidly as might have been
      expected, and as Ernest grew tired after a while of writing magazine
      articles on &lsquo;The Great Social Problem,&rsquo; which were invariably
      &lsquo;declined with thanks&rsquo; so promptly as to lead to a
      well-founded suspicion that they had never even been opened by the editor,
      he determined to employ his spare time in the production of an important
      economical volume, a treatise on the ultimate ethics of a labouring
      community, to be entitled &lsquo;The Final Rule of Social Right Living.&rsquo;
      This valuable economical work he continued to toil at for many months in
      the intervals of his other occupations; and when at last it was duly
      completed, he read it over at full length to dear little Edie, who
      considered it one of the most profoundly logical and convincing political
      treatises ever written. The various leading firms, however, to whom it was
      afterwards submitted with a view to publication, would appear, oddly
      enough, to have doubted its complete suitability to the tastes and demands
      of the reading public in the present century; for they invariably replied
      to Ernest&rsquo;s inquiries that they would be happy to undertake its
      production for the trilling sum of one hundred guineas, payable in
      advance; but that they did not see their way to accepting the risk and
      responsibility of floating so speculative a volume on their own account.
      In the end, the unhappy manuscript, after many refusals, was converted
      into cock-boats, hats, and paper dollies for little Dot; and its various
      intermediate reverses need enter no further into the main thread of this
      history. It kept Ernest busy in the spare hours of several months, and
      prevented him from thinking too much of his own immediate prospects, in
      his dreams for the golden future of humanity; and insomuch it did actually
      subserve some indirectly useful function; but on the other hand it wasted
      a considerable quantity of valuable tenpenny foolscap, and provided him
      after all with one more severe disappointment, to put on top of all the
      others to which he was just then being subjected. Clearly, the reading
      public took no paying interest in political economy; or if they did, then
      the article practically affected by the eternal laws of supply and demand
      was at least not the one meted out to them from the enthusiastic Schurzian
      pen of Ernest Le Breton.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, not long after Ernest and Edie had taken rooms at Mrs.
      Halliss&rsquo;s, they were somewhat surprised at receiving the honour of a
      casual visit from a very unexpected and unusual quarter. Ronald was with
      them, talking earnestly over the prospects of the situation, when a knock
      came at the door, and to their great astonishment the knock was quickly
      followed by the entrance of Herbert. He had never been there before, and
      Ernest felt sure he had come now for some very definite and sufficient
      purpose. And so he had indeed: it was a strange one for him; but Herbert
      Le Breton was actually bound upon a mission of charity. We have all of us
      our feelings, no doubt, and Herbert Le Breton, too, in his own fashion,
      had his. Ernest was after all a good fellow enough at bottom, and his own
      brother: (a man can&rsquo;t for very rospectability&rsquo;s sake let his
      own brother go utterly to the dogs if he can possibly help it); and so
      Herbert had made up his mind, much against his natural inclination, to
      warn Ernest of the danger he incurred in having anything more to do or say
      with this insane, disreputable old Schurz fellow. For his own part, he
      hated giving advice; people never took it; and that was a deadly offence
      against his amour propre and a gross insult to his personal dignity; but
      still, in this case, for Ernest&rsquo;s sake, he determined after an
      inward struggle to swallow his own private scruples, and make an effort to
      check his brother on the edge of the abyss. Not that he would come to the
      point at once; Herbert was a careful diplomatic agent, and he didn&rsquo;t
      spoil his hand by displaying all his cards too openly at the outset; he
      would begin upon comparatively indifferent subjects, and lead round the
      conversation gradually to the perils and errors of pure Schurzianism. So
      he set out by admiring his niece&rsquo;s fat arms&mdash;a remarkable
      stretch of kindliness on Herbert&rsquo;s part, for of course other people&rsquo;s
      babies are well known to be really the most uninteresting objects in the
      whole animate universe&mdash;and then he passed on by natural transitions
      to Ernest&rsquo;s housekeeping arrangements, and to the prospects of
      journalism as a trade, and finally to the necessity for a journalist to
      consult the tastes of his reading public. &lsquo;And by the way, Ernest,&rsquo;
      he said quietly at last, &lsquo;of course after this row at Pilbury, you&rsquo;ll
      drop the acquaintance of your very problematical German socialist.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie started in surprise. &lsquo;What? Herr Schurz?&rsquo; she said
      eagerly. ‘Dear simple, kindly old Herr Schurz! Oh no, Herbert, that I&rsquo;m
      sure he won&rsquo;t; Ernest will never drop HIS acquaintance, whatever
      happens.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert coughed drily. &lsquo;Then there are two of them for me to contend
      against,&rsquo; he said to himself with an inward smile. &lsquo;I should
      really hardly have expected that, now. One would have said a priori that
      the sound common-sense and practical regard for the dominant feelings of
      society, which is so justly strong in most women, would have kept HER at
      any rate&mdash;with her own social disabilities, too&mdash;from aiding and
      abetting her husband in such a piece of egregious folly&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      sorry to hear it, Mrs. Le Breton,&rsquo; he went on aloud,&mdash;he never
      called her by her Christian name, and Edie was somehow rather pleased that
      he didn&rsquo;t: &lsquo;for you know Herr Schurz is far from being a
      desirable acquaintance. Quite apart from his own personal worth, of course&mdash;which
      is a question that I for my part am not called upon to decide&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      a snare and a stumbling-block in the eyes of society, and very likely
      indeed to injure Ernest&rsquo;s future prospects, as he has certainly
      injured his career in the past. You know he&rsquo;s going to be tried in a
      few weeks for a seditious libel and for inciting to murder the Emperor of
      Russia. Now, you will yourself admit, Mrs. Le Breton, that it&rsquo;s an
      awkward thing to be mixed up with people who are tried on a criminal
      charge for inciting to murder. Of course, we all allow that the Czar&rsquo;s
      a very despotic and autocratic sovereign, that his existence is an
      anomaly, and that the desire to blow him up is a very natural desire for
      every intelligent Russian to harbour privately in the solitude of his own
      bosom. If we were Russians ourselves, no doubt we&rsquo;d try to blow him
      up too, if we could conveniently do so without detection. So much, every
      rational Englishman, who isn&rsquo;t blinded by prejudice or frightened by
      the mere sound of words, must at once frankly acknowledge. But
      unfortunately, you see, the mass of Englishmen ARE blinded by prejudice,
      and ARE frightened by the mere sound of words. To them, blowing up a Czar
      is murder (though of course blowing up any number of our own black people
      isn&rsquo;t); and inciting to blow up the Czar, or doing what seems to
      most Englishmen equivalent to such incitement, as for example, saying in
      print that the Czar&rsquo;s government isn&rsquo;t quite ideally perfect
      and ought gradually and tentatively to be abolished&mdash;why, that, I
      say, is a criminal offence, and is naturally punishable by a term of
      imprisonment. Now, is it worth while to mix oneself up with people like
      that, Ernest, when you can just as easily do without having anything on
      earth to say to them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie&rsquo;s face burnt scarlet as she listened, but Ernest only answered
      more quietly&mdash;he never allowed anything that Herbert said to disturb
      his equanimity&mdash;&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t think alike upon this subject,
      you know, Herbert; and I&rsquo;m afraid the disagreement is fundamental.
      It doesn&rsquo;t matter so much to us what the world thinks as what is
      abstractly right; and Edie would prefer to cling to Herr Schurz, through
      good report and evil report, rather than to be applauded by your mass of
      Englishmen for having nothing to do with inciting to murder. We know that
      Herr Max never did anything of the kind; that he is the gentlest and best
      of men; and that in Russian affairs he has always been on the side of the
      more merciful methods, as against those who would have meted out to the
      Czar the harsher measure of pure justice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,&rsquo; Herbert answered bravely, with a virtuous determination not
      to be angry at this open insult to his own opinion, but to persevere in
      his friendly efforts for his brother&rsquo;s sake, &lsquo;we won&rsquo;t
      take Herr Max into consideration at all, but will look merely at the
      general question. The fact is, Ernest, you&rsquo;ve chosen the wrong side.
      The environment is too strong for you; and if you set yourself up against
      it, it&rsquo;ll crush you between the upper and the nether mill-stone. It
      isn&rsquo;t your business to reform the world; it&rsquo;s your business to
      live in it; and if you go on as you&rsquo;re doing now, it strikes me that
      you&rsquo;ll fail at the outset in that very necessary first particular.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I fail,&rsquo; Ernest answered with a heavy heart, &lsquo;I can only
      die once; and after all every man can do no more than till to the best of
      his ability the niche in nature that he finds already cut out for him by
      circumstances.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Ernest,&rsquo; Herbert continued quietly, twisting himself a
      cigarette with placid deliberateness, as a preliminary to his departure;
      &lsquo;your great mistake in life is that you WILL persist in considering
      the universe as a cosmos. Now the fact is, it isn&rsquo;t a cosmos; it&rsquo;s
      a chaos, and a very poor one at that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes,&rsquo; Ernest answered gravely; &lsquo;nobody recognises that
      fact more absolutely than I do; but surely it&rsquo;s the duty of man to
      try as far as in him lies to cosmise his own particular little corner of
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In the abstract, certainly: as a race, most distinctly so; but as
      individuals, why, the thing&rsquo;s clearly impossible. There was one man
      who once tried to do it, and his name was Don Quixote.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There was another, I always thought,&rsquo; Ernest replied more solemnly,
      ‘and after his name we&rsquo;ve all been taught as children to call
      ourselves Christians. At bottom, my ideal is only the Christian ideal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t you see that the survival of the fittest
      must succeed in elbowing your ideal, for the present at least, out of
      existence? Look here, Ernest, you&rsquo;re going the wrong way to work
      altogether for your own happiness and comfort. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to
      me, of course; you can do as you like with yourself, and I oughtn&rsquo;t
      to interfere with you; but I do it because I&rsquo;m your brother, and
      because I take a certain amount of interest in you accordingly. Now, I
      quite grant with you that the world&rsquo;s in a very unjust social
      condition at present. I&rsquo;m not a fool, and I can&rsquo;t help seeing
      that wealth is very badly distributed, and that happiness is very
      unequally meted. But I don&rsquo;t feel called upon to make myself the
      martyr of the cause of readjustment for all that. If I were a working man,
      I should take up the side that you&rsquo;re taking up now; I should have
      everything to gain, and nothing to lose by it. But your mistake is just
      this, that when you might identify your own interests with the side of the
      &ldquo;haves,&rdquo; as I do, you go out of your way to identify them with
      the side of the &ldquo;have-nots,&rdquo; out of pure idealistic Utopian
      philanthropy. You belong by birth to the small and intrinsically weak
      minority of persons specially gifted by nature and by fortune; and why do
      you lay yourself out with all your might to hound on the mass of your
      inferiors till they trample down and destroy whatever gives any special
      importance, interest, or value to intellectual superiority, vigour of
      character, political knowledge, or even wealth? I can understand that the
      others should wish to do this; I can understand that they will inevitably
      do it in the long run; but why on earth do you, of all men, want to help
      them in pulling down a platform on which you yourself might, if you chose,
      stand well above their heads and shoulders?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Because I feel the platform&rsquo;s an unjust one,&rsquo; Ernest
      answered, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An excellent answer for them,&rsquo; Herbert chimed in, in his coldest
      and calmest tone, &lsquo;but a very insufficient one for you. The
      injustice, if any, tells all in your own favour. As long as the mob doesn&rsquo;t
      rise up and tear the platform down (as it will one day), why on earth
      should you be more anxious about it than they are?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Because, Herbert, if there must be injustice, I would rather suffer it
      than do it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, go your own way,&rsquo; Herbert answered, with a calm smile of
      superior wisdom; &lsquo;go your own way and let it land you where it will.
      For my part, I back the environment. But it&rsquo;s no business of mine; I
      have done my best to warn you. Liberavi animam meam. You won&rsquo;t take
      my advice, and I must leave you to your own devices.&rsquo; And with just
      a touch of the hand to Edie, and a careless nod to his two brothers, he
      sauntered out of the room without another word. &lsquo;As usual,&rsquo; he
      thought to himself as he walked down the stairs, ‘I go out of my way to
      give good advice to a fellow-creature, and I get only the black
      ingratitude of a snubbing in return. This is really almost enough to make
      even me turn utterly and completely selfish!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wonder, Ernest,&rsquo; said Ronald, looking up as Herbert shut the door
      gently behind him, &lsquo;how you and I ever came to have such a brother
      as Herbert!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think it&rsquo;s easy enough to understand, Ronald, on plain hereditary
      principles.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald sighed. &lsquo;I see what you mean,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      poor mother&rsquo;s strain&mdash;the Whitaker strain&mdash;coming out in
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I often fancy, Ronald, I can see the same two strains in varying
      intensity, running through all three of us alike. In Herbert the Whitaker
      strain is uppermost, and the Le Breton comparatively in abeyance; in me,
      they&rsquo;re both more or less blended; in you, the Le Breton strain
      comes out almost unadulterated. Yet even Herbert has more of a Le Breton
      in him than one might imagine, for he&rsquo;s with us intellectually; it&rsquo;s
      the emotional side only that&rsquo;s wanting to him. Even when members of
      a family are externally very much unlike one another in the mere surface
      features of their characters, I believe you can generally see the family
      likeness underlying it for all that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Only you must know how to analyse the character to see it,&rsquo; said
      Edie. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it ever struck me before that there was
      anything in common between you and Herbert, Ernest, and yet now you point
      it out I believe there really is something after all. I&rsquo;m sorry you
      told me, for I can&rsquo;t bear to think that you&rsquo;re like Herbert.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, no,&rsquo; Ronald put in hastily; &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t Ernest who
      has something in him like Herbert; it&rsquo;s Herbert who has something in
      him like Ernest. There&rsquo;s a great deal of difference between the one
      thing and the other. Besides, he hasn&rsquo;t got enough of it, Edie, and
      Ernest has.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; RONALD COMES OF AGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ‘Strange,&rsquo; Ronald Le Breton thought to himself, as he walked along
      the Embankment between Westminster and Waterloo, some weeks later&mdash;the
      day of Herr Max&rsquo;s trial,&mdash;&lsquo;I had a sort of impulse to
      come down here alone this afternoon: I felt as if there was an unseen Hand
      somehow impelling me. Depend upon it, one doesn&rsquo;t have instincts of
      that sort utterly for nothing. The Finger that guides us guides us always
      aright for its own wise and unfathomable purposes. What a blessing and a
      comfort it is to feel that one&rsquo;s steps are continually directed from
      above, and that even an afternoon stroll through the great dreary town is
      appointed to us for some fit and sufficient reason! Look at that poor girl
      over there now, at the edge of the Embankment! I wonder what on earth she
      can have come here for. Why...how pale and excited she looks. What&rsquo;s
      she going so near the edge for? Gracious heavens! it can&rsquo;t
      be...yes...it is... no, no, but still it must be...that&rsquo;s what the
      Finger was guiding me here for this afternoon. There&rsquo;s no denying
      it. The poor creature&rsquo;s tempted to destroy herself. My instinct
      tells me so at once, and it never tells me wrong. Oh, Inscrutable Wisdom,
      help me, help me: give me light to act rightly! I must go up this very
      moment and speak to her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was walking moodily along the edge of the bank, and looking in a
      dreamy fashion over the parapet into the sullen fast-flowing brown water
      below. An eye less keen than Ronald&rsquo;s might have seen in a moment,
      from her harassed weary face and her quick glance to right and left after
      the disappearing policeman, that she was turning over in her own mind
      something more desperate than any common everyday venture. Ronald stepped
      up to her hastily, and, firm in his conviction that the Finger was guiding
      him aright, spoke out at once with boldness on the mere strength of his
      rapid instinctive conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stop, stop,&rsquo; he said, laying his hand gently on her shoulder:
      &lsquo;not for a moment, I beg of you, not for a moment. Not till you&rsquo;ve
      at least told me what is your trouble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah turned round sharply and looked up in his face with a vague feeling
      of indefinable wonder. &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; she asked, in a
      husky voice. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do what? How do you know I was going to do
      anything?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You were going to throw yourself into the river,'Ronald answered
      confidently; &lsquo;or at least you were debating about it in your own
      soul. I know you were, because a sure Guide tells me so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah&rsquo;s lip curled a little at the sound of that familiar language.
      ‘And suppose I was,&rsquo; she replied, defiantly, in her reckless
      fashion; &lsquo;suppose I was: what&rsquo;s that to you or anybody, I
      should like to know? Are you your brother&rsquo;s keeper, as your own
      Bible puts it? Well, yes, then, perhaps I WAS going to drown myself: and
      if I choose, as soon as your back&rsquo;s turned, I shall go and do it
      still; so there; and that&rsquo;s all I have to say about it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald turned his face towards her with an expression of the intensest
      interest, but before he could put in a single word, Selah interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know what you&rsquo;re going to say,&rsquo; she went on, looking up at
      him rebelliously. &lsquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going to say every bit
      as well as if you&rsquo;d said it. You&rsquo;re one of these city
      missionary sort of people, you are; and you&rsquo;re going to tell me it&rsquo;s
      awfully wicked of me to try and destroy myself, and ain&rsquo;t I afraid
      of a terrible hereafter! Ugh! I hate and detest all that mummery.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald looked down upon her in return with a sort of silent wondering
      pity. &lsquo;Awfully wicked,&rsquo; he said slowly, &lsquo;awfully wicked!
      How meaningless! How incomprehensible! Awfully wicked to be friendless, or
      poor, or wretched, or unhappy! Awfully wicked to be driven by despair, or
      by heartlessness, to such a pitch of misery or frenzy that you want to
      fling yourself wildly into the river, only to be out of it all, anywhere,
      in a minute! Why you poor, unhappy girl, how on earth can you possibly
      help it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the tone of his earnest voice that melted for a
      moment even Selah Briggs&rsquo;s pride and vehemence. It was very
      impertinent of him to try and interfere with her purely personal business,
      no doubt, but he seemed to do so in a genuinely kindly rather than in a
      fussy interfering spirit. At any rate he didn&rsquo;t begin by talking to
      her that horrid cant about the attempt to commit suicide being so
      extremely wicked! If he had done that, Selah would have felt it was not
      only an unwarrantable intrusion upon her liberty of action, but a
      grotesque insult to her natural intelligence as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ve a right to drown myself if I choose,&rsquo; she faltered out,
      leaning faintly as she spoke against the parapet, &lsquo;and nobody else
      has any possible right to hinder or prevent me. If you people make laws
      against my rights in that matter, I shall set your laws aside whenever and
      wherever it happens to suit my personal convenience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Exactly so,&rsquo; Ronald answered, in the same tone of gentle and
      acquiescent persuasion. &lsquo;I quite agree with you. It&rsquo;s as clear
      as daylight that every individual human being has a perfect right to put
      an end to his own life whenever it becomes irksome or unpleasant to him;
      and nobody else has any right whatever to interfere with him. The
      prohibitions that law puts upon our freedom in that respect are only of a
      piece with the other absurd restrictions of our existing unchristian
      legislation&mdash;as opposed to the spirit of the Word as the old rule
      that made us bury a suicide at four cross roads with a hideously barbarous
      and brutal ceremonial. They&rsquo;re all mere temporary survivals from a
      primitive paganism: the truth shall make us free. But though we mayn&rsquo;t
      rightly interfere, we may surely inquire in a brotherly spirit of
      interest, whether it isn&rsquo;t possible for us to make life less irksome
      for those who, unhappily, want to get rid of it. After all, the causes of
      our discontent are often quite removable. Tell me, at least, what yours
      are, and let me see whether I&rsquo;m able to do anything towards removing
      them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah hung back a little sullenly. This was a wonderful mixture of tongues
      that the strange young man was talking in! When he spoke about the right
      and wrong of suicide, ethically considered, it might have been Herbert
      Walters himself who was addressing her: when he glided off sideways to the
      truth and the Word, it might have been her Primitive Methodist friends at
      Hastings, in full meeting assembled. And, by the way, he reminded her
      strangely, somehow, of Herbert Walters! What manner of man could he be,
      she wondered, and what strange sort of new Gospel was this that he was
      preaching to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How do I know who you are?&rsquo; she asked him, carelessly. &lsquo;How
      do I know what you want to know my story for? Perhaps you&rsquo;re only
      trying to get something out of me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Trust me,&rsquo; Ronald said simply. &lsquo;By faith we live, you know.
      Only trust me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah answered nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come over here to the bench by the garden,&rsquo; Ronald went on
      earnestly. ‘We can talk there more at our leisure. I don&rsquo;t like to
      see you leaning so close to the parapet. It&rsquo;s a temptation; I know
      it&rsquo;s a temptation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah looked at him again inquiringly. She had never before met anybody so
      curious, she fancied. &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of being seen sitting
      with me like this,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;on the Embankment benches? Some
      of your fine friends might come by and wonder who on earth you had got
      here with you.&rsquo; And, indeed, Selah&rsquo;s dress had grown very
      shabby and poor-looking during a long and often fruitless search for
      casual work or employment in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ronald only surveyed her gently from head to foot with a quiet smile,
      and answered softly, &lsquo;Oh, no; there&rsquo;s no reason on earth why
      we shouldn&rsquo;t sit down and talk together; and even if there were, my
      friends all know me far too well by this time to be surprised at anything
      I may do, when the Hand guides me. If you will only sit down and tell me
      your story, I should like to see whether I could possibly do anything to
      help you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah let him lead her in his gentle half-womanly fashion to the bench,
      and sat down beside him mechanically. Still, she made no attempt to begin
      her pitiful story. Ronald suspected for a second some special cause for
      her embarrassment, and ventured to suggest a possible way out of it.
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; he said timidly, &lsquo;you would rather speak to
      some older and more fatherly man about it, or to some kind lady. If so, I
      have many good friends in London who would listen to you with as much
      interest and attention as I should.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old spirit flared up in Selah for a second, as she answered quickly,
      &lsquo;No, no, sir, it&rsquo;s nothing of that sort. I can tell YOU as
      well as I can tell anybody. If I&rsquo;ve been unfortunate, it&rsquo;s
      been through no fault of my own, thank goodness, but only through the
      hard-heartedness and unkindness of other people. I&rsquo;d rather speak to
      you than to anyone else, because I feel somehow&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;as if you had something or other really good in you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon,&rsquo; Ronald said hastily, &lsquo;for even suggesting
      it but you see, I often have to meet a great many people who&rsquo;ve been
      unhappy through a great many different causes, and that leads one
      occasionally for a time into mistaken inferences. Let me hear all your
      history, please, and I firmly believe, through the aid that never forsakes
      us, I shall be able to do something or other to help you in your
      difficulties.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Selah began and told her whole unhappy history through,
      without pause or break, into Ronald&rsquo;s quietly sympathetic ear. She
      told him quite frankly and fully how she had picked up the acquaintance of
      a young Mr. Walters from Oxford at Hastings: how this Mr. Walters had led
      her to believe he would marry her: how she had left her home hurriedly,
      under the belief that he would be induced to keep his promise: how he had
      thrown her over to her own devices: and how she had ever since been trying
      to pick up a precarious livelihood for herself in stray ways as a
      sempstress, work for which she wag naturally very ill-fitted, and for
      which she had no introductions. She slurred over nothing on either side of
      the story; and especially she did not forget to describe the full measure
      of her troubles and trials from her Methodist friends at Hastings. Ronald
      shook his head sympathetically at this stage of the story. &lsquo;Ah, I
      know, I know,&rsquo; he muttered, half under his breath; &lsquo;nasty
      pious people! Very well meaning, very devout, very earnest, one may be
      sure of it&mdash;but oh! what terrible soul-killing people to live among!
      I can understand all about it, for I&rsquo;ve met them often&mdash;Sabbath-keeping
      folks; preaching and praying folks; worrying, bothering, fussy-religious
      folks: formalists, Pharisees, mint-anise and-cummin Christians: awfully
      anxious about your soul, and so forth, and doing their very best to make
      you as miserable all the time as a slave at the torture! I don&rsquo;t
      wonder you ran away from them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I wasn&rsquo;t really going to drown myself, you know, when you spoke
      to me.&rsquo; Selah said, quite apologetically. &lsquo;I was only just
      looking over into the beautiful brown water, and thinking how delicious it
      would be to fling oneself in there, and be carried off down to the sea,
      and rolled about for ever into pebbles on the shingle, and there would be
      an end of one altogether&mdash;oh, how lovely!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very natural,&rsquo; Ronald answered calmly. &lsquo;Very natural. Of
      course it would. I&rsquo;ve often thought the same thing myself. Still,
      one oughtn&rsquo;t, if possible, to give way to these impulses: one ought
      to do all that&rsquo;s in one&rsquo;s power to prevent such a miserable
      termination to one&rsquo;s divinely allotted existence. After all, it is
      His will, you see, that we should be happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Selah had quite finished all her story, Ronald began drawing circles
      in the road with the end of his stick, and perpending within himself what
      had better be done about it, now that all was told him. &lsquo;No work,&rsquo;
      he said, half to himself; &lsquo;no money; no food. Why, why, I suppose
      you must be hungry.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you allow me to offer you a little lunch?&rsquo; he asked,
      hesitatingly, with something of Herbert&rsquo;s stately politeness. Even
      in this last extremity, Ronald felt instinctively what was due to Selah
      Briggs&rsquo;s natural sentiments of pride and delicacy. He must speak to
      her deferentially as if she were a lady, not give her alms as if she were
      a beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time that day Selah burst suddenly into tears. ‘Oh,
      sir,&rsquo; she said, sobbing, &lsquo;you are very kind to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald waited a moment or two till her eyes were dry, and then took her
      across the gardens and into Gatti&rsquo;s. Any other man might have chosen
      some other place of entertainment under the circumstances, but Ronald, in
      his perfect simplicity of heart, looked only for the first shop where he
      could get Selah the food she needed. He ordered something hot hastily,
      and, when it came, though he had had his own lunch already, he played a
      little with a knife and fork himself for show&rsquo;s sake, in order not
      to seem as if he were merely looking on while Selah was eating. These
      little touches of feeling were not lost upon Selah: she noticed them at
      once, and recognised in what Ernest would have called her aboriginal
      unregenerate vocabulary that she was dealing with a true gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Walters,&rsquo; Ronald said, pausing a second with a bit of chop poised
      lightly on the end of his fork; &lsquo;let me see&mdash;Walters. I don&rsquo;t
      know any man of that name, myself, but I&rsquo;ve had two brothers at
      Oxford, and perhaps one of them could tell me who he is. Walters&mdash;Walters.
      You said your own name was Miss Briggs, I think, didn&rsquo;t you? My name&rsquo;s
      Ronald Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How curious,&rsquo; Selah said, colouring up. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
      remember Mr. Walters talking more than once to me about his brother
      Ronald.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed,&rsquo; Ronald answered, without even a passing tinge of
      suspicion. That any man should give a false name to other people with
      intent to deceive was a thing that would never have entered into his
      simple head&mdash;far less that his own brother Herbert should be guilty
      of such a piece of disgraceful meanness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think,&rsquo; Ronald went on, as soon as Selah had finished her lunch,
      ‘you&rsquo;d better come with me back to my mother&rsquo;s house for the
      present. I suppose, now you&rsquo;ve talked it over a little, you won&rsquo;t
      think of throwing yourself into the river any more for to-day. You&rsquo;ll
      postpone your intention for the present, won&rsquo;t you? Adjourn it sine
      die till we can see what can be done for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah smiled faintly. Even with the slight fresh spring of hope that this
      chance rencontre had roused anew within her, it seemed rather absurd and
      childish of her to have meditated suicide only an hour ago. Besides, she
      had eaten and drunk since then, and the profoundest philosophers have
      always frankly admitted that the pessimistic side of human nature is
      greatly mitigated after a good dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald called a hansom, and drove up rapidly to Epsilon Terrace. When he
      got there, he took Selah into the little back breakfast room, regardless
      of the proprieties, and began once more to consider the prospects of the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is Lady Le Breton in?&rsquo; he asked the servant: and Selah noticed with
      surprise and wonder that this strange young man&rsquo;s mother was
      actually &lsquo;a lady of title,&rsquo; as she called it to herself in her
      curious ordinary language.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir,&rsquo; the girl answered; &lsquo;she have been gone out about an
      hour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then I must leave you here while I go out and get you lodgings for the
      present,&rsquo; Ronald said, quietly; &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t object to my
      doing that, of course: you can easily pay me back from your salary as soon
      as we succeed in finding you some suitable occupation. Let me see, where
      can I put you for the next fortnight? Naturally you wouldn&rsquo;t like to
      live with religious people, would you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hate them,&rsquo; Selah answered vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course, of course,&rsquo; Ronald went on, as if to himself. &lsquo;Perfectly
      natural. She hates them! So should I if I&rsquo;d been bothered and
      worried out of my life by them in the way she has. I hate them myself&mdash;that
      kind: or, rather, it&rsquo;s wrong to say that of them, poor creatures,
      for they mean well, they really mean well at bottom, in their blundering,
      formal, pettifogging way. They think they can take the kingdom of Heaven,
      not by storm, but by petty compliances, like servile servants who have to
      deal with a capricious, exacting master. Poor souls, they know no better.
      They measure the universe by the reflection in their muddy mill-pond.
      Nasty pious people is what I always call them; nasty pious people: little
      narrow souls, trying hard to be Christians after their lights, and only
      attaining, after all, to a sort of second-hand diluted Judaism, a religion
      of cup-washing, and phylacteries, and new moons, and sabbaths, and daily
      sacrifices. However, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. I won&rsquo;t
      hand you over, Miss Briggs, to any of those poor benighted people. No, nor
      to any religious people at all. It wouldn&rsquo;t suit you: you want to be
      well out of it. I know the very place for you. There are the Baumanns:
      they&rsquo;d be glad to let a room: Baumann&rsquo;s a German refugee, and
      a friend of Ernest&rsquo;s: a good man, but a secularist. THEY wouldn&rsquo;t
      bother you with any religion: poor things, they haven&rsquo;t got any.
      Mrs. Baumann&rsquo;s an excellent woman&mdash;educated, too; no objection
      at all in any way to the Baumanns. They&rsquo;re people I like and respect
      immensely&mdash;every good quality they have; and I&rsquo;m often grieved
      to think such excellent people should be deprived of the comfort and
      pleasure of believing. But, then, so&rsquo;s my dear brother Ernest; and
      you know, they&rsquo;re none the worse for it, apparently, any of them:
      indeed, I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s anybody with whom I can talk
      more sympathetically on spiritual matters than dear Ernest. Depend upon
      it, most of the most spiritually-minded people nowadays are outside all
      the churches altogether.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah listened in blank amazement to this singular avowal of heterodox
      opinion from an obviously religious person. What Ronald Le Breton could be
      she couldn&rsquo;t imagine; and she thought with an inward smile of the
      very different way in which her friends at Hastings would have discussed
      the spiritual character of a wicked secularist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment a latch-key turned lightly in the street door, and two
      sets of footsteps came down the passage to Lady Le Breton&rsquo;s little
      back breakfast-room. One set turned up the staircase, the other halted for
      a second at the breakfast-room doorway. Then the door opened gently, and
      Herbert Le Breton and Selah Briggs stood face to face again in blank
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, as Selah rose with burning cheeks from
      the chair where she was sitting; and neither spoke a word as they looked
      with eyes of mutual suspicion and dislike into each other&rsquo;s faces.
      At last Herbert Le Breton turned with some acerbity to his brother Ronald,
      and asked in a voice of affected contempt, &lsquo;Who is this woman?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This LADY&rsquo;S name is Miss Briggs,&rsquo; Ronald answered, pointedly,
      but, of course, quite innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I needn&rsquo;t ask you who this man is,&rsquo; Selah said, with bitter
      emphasis. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Herbert Walters.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrible light burst in upon Ronald instantaneously as she uttered the
      name; but he could not believe it; he would not believe it: it was too
      terrible, too incredible. &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he said falteringly,
      turning to Selah; &lsquo;you must be mistaken. This is not Mr. Walters.
      This is my brother, Herbert Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah gazed into Herbert&rsquo;s slinking eyes with a concentrated
      expression of scorn and disgust. &lsquo;Then he gave me a false name,&rsquo;
      she said, slowly, fronting him like a tigress. &lsquo;He gave me a false
      name, it seems, from the very beginning. All through, the false wretch,
      all through, he actually meant to deceive me. He laid his vile scheme for
      it beforehand. I never wish to see you again, you miserable cur, Herbert
      Le Breton, if that&rsquo;s your real name at last. I never wish to see you
      again: but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve done it now by accident, if it were
      only to inflict upon you the humiliation of knowing that I have measured
      the utmost depth of your infamy! You mean, common, false scoundrel, I have
      measured to the bottom the depth of your infamy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Ronald said imploringly, laying his hand upon her
      arm. ‘He deserves it, no doubt; but don&rsquo;t glory over his
      humiliation.&rsquo; He had no need to ask whether she spoke the truth; his
      brother&rsquo;s livid and scarlet face was evidence enough against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, however, answered nothing. He merely turned angrily to Ronald.
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t bandy words,&rsquo; he said constrainedly in his
      coldest tone, &lsquo;with this infamous woman whom you have brought here
      on purpose to insult me; but I must request you to ask her to leave the
      house immediately. Your mother&rsquo;s home is no place to which to bring
      people of such a character.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the door opened again, and Lady Le Breton, attracted by the
      sound of angry voices, entered unexpectedly. &lsquo;What does all this
      riot mean, Herbert?&rsquo; she asked, imperiously. &lsquo;Who on earth is
      this young woman that Ronald has brought into my own house, actually
      without my permission?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert whispered a few words quietly into her ear, and then left the room
      hurriedly with a stiff and formal bow to his brother Ronald. Lady Le
      Breton turned round to the culprit severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Disgraceful, Ronald!&rsquo; she cried in her sternest and most angry
      voice; &lsquo;perfectly disgraceful! You aid and abet this wretched
      creature&mdash;whose object is only to extort money by false pretences out
      of your brother Herbert&mdash;you aid and abet her in her abominable
      stratagems, and you even venture to introduce her clandestinely into my
      own breakfast-room. I wonder you&rsquo;re not ashamed of yourself. What on
      earth can you mean by such extraordinary, such unChristian conduct? Go to
      your own room this moment, sir, and ask this young woman to leave the
      house immediately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I shall go without being asked,&rsquo; Selah said, proudly, her big eyes
      flashing defiance haughtily into Lady Le Breton&rsquo;s. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know who you all may be, or what this gentleman who brought me here may
      have to do with you: but if you are in any way connected with that wretch
      Herbert Le Breton, who called himself Herbert Walters for the sake of
      deceiving me, I don&rsquo;t want to have anything further to say to any of
      the whole pack of you. Please stand out of my way,&rsquo; she went on to
      Ronald, &lsquo;and I shall have done with you all together this very
      instant. I wish to God I had never seen a single one of you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no, not just yet, please,&rsquo; Ronald put in hastily. &lsquo;You
      mustn&rsquo;t go just yet, I implore you, I beg of you, till I have
      explained to my mother, before you, how this all happened; and then, when
      you go, I shall go with you. Though I have the misfortune to be the
      brother of the man who gave you a false name in order to deceive you, I
      trust you will still allow me to help you as far as I am able, and to take
      you to my German friends of whom I spoke to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ronald,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton cried, in her most commanding tone, &lsquo;you
      must have taken leave of your senses. How dare you keep this person a
      moment longer in my house against my wish, when even she herself is
      anxious to quit it? Let her go at once, let her go at once, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, mother,&rsquo; Ronald answered firmly. &lsquo;We are commanded in the
      Word to obey our parents in all things, &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo; I think
      you&rsquo;ve forgotten that proviso, mother, &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo;
      Now, mother, I will tell you all about it.&rsquo; And then, in a rapid
      sketch, Ronald, with his back planted solidly against the door, told his
      mother briefly all he knew about Selah Briggs, how he had found her, how
      he had brought her home not knowing who she was, and how she had
      recognised Herbert as her unfaithful lover. Lady Le Breton, when she saw
      that escape was practically impossible, flung herself back in an
      easy-chair, where she swayed herself backward and forward gently all the
      while, without once lifting her eyes towards Ronald, and sighed
      impatiently from time to time audibly, as if the story merely bored her.
      As for poor Selah, she stood upright in front of Ronald without a word,
      looking neither to the right nor to the left, and waiting eagerly for the
      story to be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ronald had said his say, Lady Le Breton looked up at last and said
      simply, with a pretended yawn, &lsquo;Now, Ronald, will you go to your own
      room?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I will not,&rsquo; Ronald answered, in a soft whisper. &lsquo;I will go
      with this lady to the rooms of which I have spoken to her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton said coldly, &lsquo;you shall not return
      here. It seems I&rsquo;m to lose all my children, one after another, by
      their extraordinary rebelliousness!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By your own act&mdash;yes,&rsquo; Ronald answered, very calmly. &lsquo;You
      forgot that last Thursday was my birthday, I daresay, mother; but I didn&rsquo;t
      forget it; it was; and I came of age then. I&rsquo;m my own master now. I&rsquo;ve
      stopped here as long as I could, mother, because of the commandment: but I
      can&rsquo;t stop here any longer. I shall go to Ernest&rsquo;s for
      to-night as soon as I&rsquo;ve got rooms for this lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good evening,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton said, bowing frigidly, without
      another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good evening, mother,&rsquo; Ronald replied, in his natural voice.
      &lsquo;Miss Briggs, will you come with me? I&rsquo;m very sorry that this
      unhappy scene should have been inflicted upon you against my will; but I
      hope and pray that you won&rsquo;t have lost all confidence in my wish to
      help you, in spite of these unfortunate accidents.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah followed him blindly, in a dazzled fashion, out on to the flagstones
      of Epsilon Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear me, dear me,&rsquo; moaned Lady Le Breton, sinking back vacantly
      once more, with an air of resignation after her efforts, into the
      easy-chair: &lsquo;was there ever a mother so plagued and burdened with
      unnatural and undutiful sons as I am? If it weren&rsquo;t for dear
      Herbert, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what I should ever do between
      them. Ronald, too, who always pretended to be so very, very religious! To
      think that he should go and uphold the word of a miserable, abandoned,
      improper adventuress against his own brother Herbert! Atrocious, perfectly
      atrocious! Where on earth he can have picked up such a woman I&rsquo;m
      positively at a loss to imagine. But it&rsquo;s exactly like his poor dear
      father: I remember once when we were stationed at Moozuffernugger, in the
      North-West Provinces, with the 14th Bengal, poor Owen absolutely insisted
      on taking up the case of some Eurasian woman, who pretended she&rsquo;d
      been badly treated by young Walker of our regiment! I call it quite
      improper&mdash;almost unseemly&mdash;to meddle in the affairs of such
      people. I daresay Herbert has had something or other to say to this horrid
      girl; young men will be young men, and in the army we know how to make
      allowances for that sort of thing: but that Ronald should positively think
      of bringing such a person into my breakfast-room is not to be heard of.
      Ronald&rsquo;s a pure Le Breton&mdash;that&rsquo;s undeniable, thank
      goodness; not a single one of the good Whitaker points to be found in all
      his nature. However, poor dear Sir Owen, in spite of all his nonsense, was
      at least an officer and a gentleman; whereas the nonsense these boys have
      picked up at Oxford and among their German refugee people is both
      irreligious, and, I may even say, indecent, or, to put it in the mildest
      way, indecorous. I wish with all my heart I&rsquo;d never sent them to
      Oxford. I&rsquo;ve always thought that if only Ernest had gone in for a
      direct commission, he&rsquo;d soon have got all that absurd revolutionary
      rubbish knocked out of him in a mess-room! But it&rsquo;s a great comfort
      to me to think I have one real blessing in dear Herbert, who&rsquo;s just
      such a son as any mother might well be thoroughly proud of in every way!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Lady Le Breton was thus communing with herself in the
      breakfast-room, and while Herbert was trying to patch up a hollow truce
      with his own much-bruised self-respect in his own bedroom, Ronald was
      taking poor dazed and wearied Selah round to the refuge of the Baumanns&rsquo;
      hospitable roof. As soon as that matter was temporarily arranged to the
      mutual satisfaction of all the parties concerned, Ronald walked over alone
      to Ernest&rsquo;s little lodgings at Holloway. He would sleep there that
      night, and send round a letter to Amelia, the housemaid, in the morning,
      asking her to pack up his things and forward them at once to Mrs. Halliss&rsquo;s.
      For himself, he did not propose, unless circumstances compelled it, again
      to enter his mother&rsquo;s rooms, except by her own express invitation.
      After all, he thought, even his little income, if clubbed with Edie and
      Ernest&rsquo;s, would probably help them all to live now in tolerable
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he told Edie all his story, and Edie listened to it with an approving
      smile. &lsquo;I think, dear Ronald,&rsquo; she said, taking his hand in
      hers, &lsquo;you did quite right&mdash;quite as Ernest himself would have
      done under the circumstances.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Where&rsquo;s Ernest?&rsquo; asked Ronald, half smiling at that naive
      wifely standard of right conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Gone with Mr. Berkeley to the trial,&rsquo; Edie answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The trial! What trial?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, don&rsquo;t you know? Herr Max&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;re trying him
      to-day for littering a seditious libel and inciting to murder the chief of
      the Third Section at St. Petersburg.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But he said nothing at all,&rsquo; Ronald cried in astonishment. &lsquo;I
      read the article myself. He said nothing that any Englishman mightn&rsquo;t
      have said under the same circumstances. Why, I could have written the
      libel, as they call it, myself, even, and I&rsquo;m not much of a
      politician either! They can&rsquo;t ever be trying him in a country like
      England for anything so ridiculously little as that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But they are,&rsquo; Edie answered quietly; &lsquo;and dear Ernest&rsquo;s
      dreadfully afraid the verdict will go against him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nonsense,&rsquo; Ronald answered with natural confidence. &lsquo;No
      English jury would ever convict a man for speaking up like that against an
      odious and abominable tyranny.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Very late in the afternoon, Ernest and Berkeley returned to the lodgings.
      Ernest&rsquo;s face was white with excitement, and his lips were trembling
      violently with suppressed emotion. His eyes were red and swollen. Edie
      hardly needed to ask in a breathless whisper of Arthur Berkeley, &lsquo;What
      verdict?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Guilty,&rsquo; Arthur Berkeley answered with a look of unfeigned horror
      and indignation. He had learnt by this time quite to take the communistic
      view of such questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Guilty,&rsquo; Ronald cried, jumping up from his chair in astonishment.
      ‘Impossible! And what sentence?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Twelve months&rsquo; hard labour,&rsquo; Berkeley answered, slowly and
      remorsefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An atrocious sentence!&rsquo; Ronald exclaimed, turning red with
      excitement. ‘An abominable sentence! A most malignant and vindictive
      sentence! Who was the judge, Arthur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bassenthwaite,&rsquo; Berkeley replied half under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And may the Lord have mercy upon his soul!&rsquo; said Ronald solemnly,
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ernest never said a single word. He only sat down and ate his supper
      in silence, like one stunned and dazzled. He didn&rsquo;t even notice
      Ronald&rsquo;s coming. And Edie knew by his quick breath and his face
      alternately flushed and pallid that there would be another crisis in his
      gathering complaint before the next morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; TELL IT NOT IN OATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As they sat silent in that little sitting-room after supper, a double
      knock at the door suddenly announced the arrival of a telegram for Ernest.
      He opened it with trembling lingers. It was from Lancaster:&mdash;&lsquo;Come
      down to the office at once. Schurz has been sentenced to a year&rsquo;s
      imprisonment, and we want a leader about him for to-morrow.&rsquo; The
      telegram roused Ernest at once from his stupefied lethargy. Here was a
      chance at last of doing something for Max Schurz and for the cause of
      freedom! Here was a chance of waking up all England to a sense of the
      horrible crime it had just committed through the voice of its duly
      accredited judicial mouthpiece! The country was trembling on the brink of
      an abyss, and he, Ernest Le Breton, might just be in time to save it. The
      Home Secretary must be compelled by the unanimous clamour of thirty
      millions of free working people to redress the gross injustice of the law
      in sending Max Sohurz, the greatest, noblest, and purest-minded of
      mankind, to a common felon&rsquo;s prison! Nothing else on earth could
      have moved Ernest, jaded and dispirited as he was at that moment, to the
      painful exertion of writing a newspaper leader after the day&rsquo;s
      fatigues and excitements, except the thought that by doing so he might not
      only blot out this national disgrace, as he considered it, but might also
      help to release the martyr of the people&rsquo;s rights from his
      incredible, unspeakable punishment. Flushed and feverish though he was, he
      rose straight up from the table, handed the telegram to Edie without a
      word, and started off alone to hail a hansom cab and drive down
      immediately to the office. Arthur Berkeley, fearful of what might happen
      to him in his present excited state, stole out after him quietly, and
      followed him unperceived in another hansom at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ernest got to the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence&rsquo; buildings, he
      was shown up at once into the editorial room. He expected to find Mr.
      Lancaster at the same white heat of indignation as himself; but to his
      immense surprise he actually found him in the usual sleepy languid
      condition of apathetic impartiality. &lsquo;I wired for you, Le Breton,&rsquo;
      the impassive editor said calmly, &lsquo;because I understand you know all
      about this man Schurz, who has just got his twelve months&rsquo;
      imprisonment this evening. I suppose, of course, you&rsquo;ve heard
      already all about it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ve been at the trial all day,&rsquo; Ernest answered, &lsquo;and
      myself heard the verdict and sentence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good,&rsquo; Mr. Lancaster said, with a dreamy touch of approval in his
      tone. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good journalism, certainly, and very smart of
      you. Helps you to give local colour and realistic touches to the matter.
      But you ought to have called in here to see me immediately. We shall have
      a regular reporter&rsquo;s report of the trial, of course; but reporters&rsquo;
      reports are fearfully and wonderfully lifeless. If you like, besides the
      leader, you might work up a striking headed article on the Scene in Court.
      This is an important case, and we want something more about it than mere
      writing, you know; a little about the man himself and his personal
      history, which Berkeley tells me you&rsquo;re well acquainted with. He&rsquo;s
      written something called &ldquo;Gold and the Proletariate,&rdquo; or
      whatever it is; just tell our readers all about it. As to the leader, say
      what you like in it&mdash;of course I shall look over the proof, and tone
      it down a bit to suit the taste of our public&mdash;we appeal mainly to
      the mercantile middle class, I need hardly say; but you know the general
      policy of the paper, and you can just write what you think best, subject
      to subsequent editorial revision. Get to work at once, please, as the
      articles are wanted immediately, and send down slips as fast as they&rsquo;re
      written to the printers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest could hardly contain his surprise at Mr. Lancaster&rsquo;s calmness
      under such unheard-of circumstances, when the whole laborious fabric of
      British liberties was tottering visibly to its base&mdash;but he wisely
      concluded to himself that the editor had to see articles written about
      every possible subject every evening&mdash;from a European convulsion to a
      fire at a theatre,&mdash;and that use must have made it in him a property
      of easiness. When a man&rsquo;s obliged to work himself up perpetually
      into a state of artificial excitement about every railway accident,
      explosion, shipwreck, earthquake, or volcanic eruption, in Europe, Asia,
      Africa, America, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, why then, Ernest
      charitably said to himself, his sympathies must naturally end by getting a
      trifle callous, especially when he&rsquo;s such a very apathetic person to
      start with as this laconic editorial Lancaster. So he turned into the
      little bare box devoted to his temporary use, and began writing with
      perfectly unexampled and extraordinary rapidity at his leader and his
      article about the injured and martyred apostle of the slighted communistic
      religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a few months since Ernest had, with vast toil and forethought,
      spun slowly out his maiden newspaper article on the Italian organ-boy, and
      now he found himself, to his own immense surprise, covering sheet after
      sheet of paper in feverish haste with a long account of Max Schurz&rsquo;s
      splendid life and labours, and with a really fervid and eloquent appeal to
      the English people not to suffer such a man as he to go helplessly and
      hopelessly to an English prison, at the bare bidding of a foreign despot.
      He never stopped for one moment to take thought, or to correct what he had
      written; in the excitement of the moment his pen travelled along over the
      paper as if inspired, and he found the words and thoughts thronging his
      brain almost faster than his lagging hand could suffice to give them
      visible embodiment. As each page was thrown off hurriedly, he sent it
      down, still pale and wet, to the printers in the office; and before two o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning, he had full proofs of all he had written sent up to him
      for final correction. It was a stirring and vigorous leader, he felt quite
      certain himself as he read it over; and he thought with a swelling breast
      that it would appear next day, with all the impersonal authority of the
      &lsquo;Morning Intelligence&rsquo; stamped upon its face, at ten thousand
      English breakfast tables, where it might rouse the people in their
      millions to protest sternly before it was too late against this horrid
      violation of our cherished and boasted national hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Arthur Berkeley had stopped at the office, and run in hastily
      for five minutes&rsquo; talk with the terrible editor. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      say anything to shock Le Breton, I beg of you, Lancaster,&rsquo; he said,
      ‘about this poor man Schurz who has just been sent for a year to prison.
      It&rsquo;s a very hard case, and I&rsquo;m awfully sorry for the man
      myself, though that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. I can see from your
      face that you, for your part, don&rsquo;t sympathise with him; but at any
      rate, don&rsquo;t say anything about it to hurt Le Breton&rsquo;s
      feelings. He&rsquo;s in a dreadfully feverish and excited condition this
      evening; Max Schurz has always been to him almost like a father, and he
      naturally takes his sentence very bitterly to heart. To tell you the
      truth, I regret it a great deal myself, I know a little of Schurz, through
      Le Breton, and I know what a well-meaning, ardent, enthusiastic person he
      really is, and how much good actually underlies all his chaotic
      socialistic notions. But at any rate, I do beg of you, don&rsquo;t say
      anything to further excite and hurt poor Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Certainly not,&rsquo; the editor answered, smoothing his large hands
      softly one over the other. &lsquo;Certainly not; though I confess, as a
      practical man, I don&rsquo;t sympathise in the least with this
      preposterous German refugee fellow. So far as I can learn, he&rsquo;s been
      at the bottom of half the revolutionary and insurrectionary movements of
      the last twenty years&mdash;a regular out-and-out professional socialistic
      incendiary.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You wouldn&rsquo;t say so,&rsquo; Berkeley replied quietly, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;d
      seen more of him, Lancaster.&rsquo; But being a man of the world, and
      having come mainly on Ernest&rsquo;s account, he didn&rsquo;t care to
      press the abstract question of Herr Max&rsquo;s political sincerity any
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,&rsquo; the editor went on, a little testily, &lsquo;be that as it
      may, I won&rsquo;t discuss the subject with your friend Le Breton, who&rsquo;s
      really a nice, enthusiastic young fellow, I think, as far as I&rsquo;ve
      seen him. I&rsquo;ll simply let him write to-night whatever he pleases,
      and make the necessary alterations in proof afterwards, without talking it
      over with him personally at all. That&rsquo;ll avoid any needless
      discussion and ruffling of his supersensitive communistic feelings. Poor
      fellow, he looks very ill indeed to-night. I&rsquo;m really extremely
      sorry for him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When will he be finished?&rsquo; asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘At two,&rsquo; the editor answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;ll send a cab for him,&rsquo; Arthur said; &lsquo;there&rsquo;ll
      be none about at that hour, probably. Will you kindly tell him it&rsquo;s
      waiting for him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o&rsquo;clock or a little after, Ernest drove home with his heart
      on fire, full of eagerness and swelling hope for to-morrow morning. He
      found Edie waiting for him, late as it was, with a little bottle of wine&mdash;an
      unknown luxury at Mrs. Halliss&rsquo;s lodgings&mdash;and such light
      supper as she thought he could manage to swallow in his excitement. Ernest
      drank a glass of the wine, but left the supper untasted. Then he went to
      bed, and tossed about uneasily till morning. He couldn&rsquo;t sleep
      through his anxiety to see his great leader appear in all the added
      dignity of printer&rsquo;s ink and rouse the slumbering world of England
      up to a due sense of Max Schurz&rsquo;s wrongs and the law&rsquo;s
      incomprehensible iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before seven, he rose very quietly, dressed himself without saying a word,
      and stole out to buy an early copy of the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence.&rsquo;
      He got one at the small tobacconist&rsquo;s shop round the corner, where
      he had taken his first hint for the Italian organ-boy leader. It was with
      difficulty that he could contain himself till he was back in Mrs. Halliss&rsquo;s
      little front parlour; and there he tore open the paper eagerly, and turned
      to the well-remembered words at the beginning of his desperate appealing
      article. He could recollect the very run of every clause and word he had
      written: &lsquo;No Englishman can read without a thrill of righteous
      indignation,&rsquo; it began,'the sentence passed last night upon Max
      Schurz, the author of that remarkable economical work, &ldquo;Gold and the
      Proletariate.&rdquo; Herr Schurz is one of those numerous refugees from
      German despotism who have taken advantage of the hospitable welcome
      usually afforded by England to the oppressed of all creeds or nations&rsquo;&mdash;and
      so forth, and so forth. Where was it now? Yes, that was it, in the place
      of honour, of course&mdash;the first leader under the clock in the &lsquo;Morning
      Intelligence.&rsquo; His eye caught at once the opening key-words, &lsquo;No
      Englishman.&rsquo; Sinking down into the easy-chair by the flowers in the
      window he prepared to run it through at his leisure with breathless
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No Englishman can read without a feeling of the highest approval the
      sentence passed last night upon Max Schurz, the author of that misguided
      economical work, &ldquo;Gold and the Proletariate.&rdquo; Herr Schurz is
      one of those numerous refugees from German authority, who have taken
      advantage of the hospitable welcome usually afforded by England to the
      oppressed of all creeds or nations, in order to hatch plots in security
      against the peace of sovereigns or governments with which we desire always
      to maintain the most amicable and cordial relations.&rsquo; Ernest&rsquo;s
      eyes seemed to fail him. The type on the paper swam wildly before his
      bewildered vision. What on earth could this mean? It was his own leader,
      indeed, with the very rhythm and cadence of the sentences accurately
      preserved, but with all the adjectives and epithets so ingeniously altered
      that it was turned into a crushing condemnation of Max Schurz, his
      principles, his conduct, and his ethical theories. From beginning to end,
      the article appealed to the common-sense of intelligent Englishmen to
      admire the dignity of the law in thus vindicating itself against the
      atrocious schemes of a dangerous and ungrateful political exile who had
      abused the hospitality of a great free country to concoct vile plots
      against the persons of friendly sovereigns and innocent ministers on the
      European continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest laid down the paper dreamily, and leant back for a moment in his
      chair, to let his brain recover a little from the reeling dizziness of
      that crushing disappointment. Then he turned in a giddy mechanical fashion
      to the headed article on the fourth page. There the self-same style of
      treatment met once more his astonished gaze. All the minute facts as to
      Max Schurz&rsquo;s history and personality were carefully preserved; the
      description of his simple artisan life, his modest household, his Sunday
      evening receptions, his great following of earnest and enthusiastic
      refugees&mdash;every word of all this, which hardly anyone else could have
      equally well supplied, was retained intact in the published copy; yet the
      whole spirit of the thing had utterly evaporated, or rather had been
      perverted into the exact opposite unsympathetic channel. Where Ernest had
      written &lsquo;enthusiasm,&rsquo; Lancaster had simply altered the word to
      ‘fanaticism;&rsquo; where Ernest had spoken of Herr Max&rsquo;s &lsquo;single-hearted
      devotion,&rsquo; Lancaster had merely changed the phrase into &lsquo;undisguised
      revolutionary ardour.&rsquo; The whole paper was one long sermon against
      Max Schurz&rsquo;s Utopian schemes, imputing to him not only folly but
      even positive criminality as well. We all know how we all in England look
      upon the foreign political refugee&mdash;a man to be hit again with
      impunity, because he has no friends; but to Ernest, who had lived so long
      in his own little socialistic set, the discovery that people could openly
      say such things against his chosen apostle at the very moment of his
      martyrdom, was a hideous and blinding disillusionment. He put the paper
      down upon the table once more, and buried his face helplessly between his
      burning hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of it all was this: if Herr Max ever saw those articles he would
      naturally conclude that Ernest had been guilty of the basest treachery,
      and that too on the very day when he most needed the aid and sympathy of
      all his followers. With a thrill of horror he thought in his own soul that
      the great leader might suspect him for an hour of being the venal Judas of
      the little sect.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Ernest ever got through that weary day he did not know himself;
      nothing kept him up through it except his burning indignation against
      Lancaster&rsquo;s abominable conduct. About eleven o&rsquo;clock, Arthur
      Berkeley called in to see him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve been a
      little disappointed,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;about the turn Lancaster has
      given to your two articles. He told me he meant to alter the tone so as to
      suit the policy of the paper, and I see he&rsquo;s done so very
      thoroughly. You can&rsquo;t look for much sympathy from commonplace, cold,
      calculating Englishmen for enthusiastic natures like Herr Max&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest turned to him in blank amazement. He had expected Berkeley to be as
      angry as himself at Lancaster&rsquo;s shameful mutilation of his appealing
      leader; and he found now that even Berkeley accepted it as an ordinary
      incident in the course of journalistic business. His heart sank within him
      as he thought how little hope there could be of Herr Max&rsquo;s
      liberation, when even his own familiar friend Berkeley looked upon the
      matter in such a casual careless fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I shall never write another word for the &ldquo;Morning Intelligence,&rdquo;&rsquo;
      he cried vehemently, after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &lsquo;If we starve for
      it, I shall never write another word in that wicked, abominable,
      dishonourable paper. I can die easily enough, heaven knows, without a
      murmur: but I can&rsquo;t be disloyal to dear Herr Max, and to all my
      innate ingrained principles.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don&rsquo;t say that, Ernest,&rsquo; Berkeley answered gently. &lsquo;Think
      of Mrs. Le Breton and the baby. The luxury of starvation for the sake of a
      cause is one you might venture to allow yourself if you were alone in the
      world as I am, but not one which you ought to force unwillingly upon your
      wife and children. You&rsquo;ve been getting a trifle more practical of
      late under the spur of necessity; don&rsquo;t go and turn impossible again
      at the supreme moment. Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s your plain duty to go
      on writing for the &ldquo;Morning Intelligence.&rdquo; You say with your
      own hand only what you think and believe yourself: the editor alone is
      responsible for the final policy of the paper.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest only muttered slowly to himself,&mdash;&lsquo;Never, never, never!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though the first attempt had failed, Ernest did not wholly give up
      his hopes of doing something towards the release of Herr Max from that
      unutterable imprisonment. He drew up a form of petition to the Home
      Secretary, in which he pointed out the reasons for setting aside the
      course of the law in the case of this particular political prisoner. With
      feverish anxiety he ran about London for the next two days, trying to get
      influential signatures to his petition, and to rouse the people in their
      millions to demand the release of the popular martyr. Alas for the stolid
      indifference of the British public! The people in their millions sat down
      to eat and drink, and rose up to play, exactly as if nothing unusual in
      any way had happened. Most of them had never heard at all of Herr Max, or
      of &lsquo;Gold and the Proletariate,&rsquo; and those who had heard
      understood for the most part that he was a bad lot who was imprisoned for
      trying nefariously to blow up the Emperor of Rooshia. Crowds of people
      nightly besieged the doors of the Ambiguities and the Marlborough, to hear
      the fate of &lsquo;The Primate of Fiji&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Duke of
      Bermondsey;&rsquo; but very few among the millions took the trouble to
      sign their names to Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s despairing petition. Even the
      advanced radicals of the market-place, the men who figured largely at
      Trafalgar Square meetings and Agricultural Labourers&rsquo; Unions, feared
      to damage their reputation for moderation and sobriety by getting
      themselves mixed up with a continental agitator like this man Schurz that
      people were talking about. The Irish members expressed a pious horror of
      the very word dynamite: the working-man leaders hemmed and hawed, and
      regretted their inability, in their very delicate position, to do anything
      which might seem like countenancing Russian nihilism. In the end, Ernest
      sent, in his petition with only half a dozen unknown signatures; and the
      Home Secretary&rsquo;s private prompter threw it into the waste-paper
      basket entire, without even taking the trouble to mention its existence to
      his harassed and overburdened chief. Just a Marylebone communist refugee
      in prison! How could a statesman with half the bores and faddists of
      England on his troubled hands, find time to look at uninfluential
      petitions about an insignificant worthless nobody like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      So gentle, noble-natured, learned Herr Max went to prison and served his
      year there uncomplainingly, like any other social malefactor; and Society
      talked about his case with languid interest for nearly a fortnight, and
      then straightway found a new sensation, and forgot all about him. But
      there are three hundred and sixty-five days of twenty-four hours each in
      every year; and for every one of those days Herr Max and Herr Max&rsquo;s
      friends never forgot for an hour together that he was in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the end of the week Ernest got a letter from Lancaster, enclosing a
      cheque for eight guineas. That is a vast sum of money, eight guineas: just
      think of all the bread, and meat, and tea, and clothing one can buy with
      it for a small family! &lsquo;My dear Le Breton,&rsquo; the editor wrote&mdash;in
      his own hand, too; a rare honour; for he was a kindly man, and he had
      learned, much to his surprise, from Arthur Berkeley, that Ernest was angry
      at his treatment of the Schurzian leader: &lsquo;My dear Le Breton, I
      enclose cheque for eight guineas, for your two articles. I hope you didn&rsquo;t
      mind the way I was obliged to cut them up in some unessential details, so
      as to suit the policy of the paper. I kept whatever was really most
      distinctive as embodying special information in them. You know we are
      above all things strictly moderate. Please send us another social shortly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a kind letter, undoubtedly a kind and kindly-meant letter: but
      Ernest flung it from him as though he had been stung by a serpent or a
      scorpion. Then he handed the cheque to Edie in solemn silence, to see what
      she would do with it. He merely wanted to try her constancy. For himself,
      he would have felt like a Judas indeed if he had taken and used their
      thirty pieces of silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie looked at the cheque intently and sighed a deep sigh of regret. How
      could she do otherwise? They were so very poor, and it was such an immense
      sum of money! Then she rose quietly without saying a word, and lighted a
      match from the box on the mantelpiece. She held the cheque firmly between
      her finger and thumb till it was nearly burnt, end let it drop slowly at
      last into the empty fireplace. Ernest rose up and kissed her tenderly. The
      leaden weight of the thirty pieces of silver was fairly off their united
      conscience. They had made what reparation they could for the evil of that
      unhappy, undesigned leader. After all Ernest had wasted the last remnant
      of his energy on one eventful evening, all for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Edie sat looking wistfully at the smouldering fragments of the burnt
      cheque, Ernest roused her again by saying quietly, &lsquo;To-day&rsquo;s
      Saturday. Have we got anything for to-morrow&rsquo;s dinner, Edie?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing,&rsquo; Edie answered, simply. &lsquo;How much money have you
      left, Ernest?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sixpence,&rsquo; Ernest said, without needing to consult his empty purse
      for confirmation&mdash;he had counted the pence, as they went, too
      carefully for that already. &lsquo;Edie, I&rsquo;m afraid we must go at
      last to the poor man&rsquo;s banker till I can get some more money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Ernest&mdash;not&mdash;not&mdash;not the pawnbroker!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Edie, the pawnbroker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears came quickly into Edie&rsquo;s eyes, but she answered nothing.
      They must have food, and there was no other way open before them. They
      rose together and went quietly into the bedroom. There they gathered
      together the few little trinkets and other things that might be of use to
      them, and Ernest took down his hat from the stand to go out with them to
      the pawnbroker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned out he was met energetically on the landing by a stout
      barricade from good Mrs. Halliss. &lsquo;No, sir, not you, sir,&rsquo; the
      landlady said firmly, trying to take the parcel from him as he went
      towards the door. &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir, for &lsquo;avin&rsquo;
      over&rsquo;eard what wasn&rsquo;t meant for me to &lsquo;ear, no doubt,
      but I couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;elp it, sir, and John an&rsquo; me can&rsquo;t
      allow nothink of this sort, we can&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re used to this sort
      o&rsquo; things, sir, John and me is; but you and the dear lady isn&rsquo;t
      used to &lsquo;em, sir, and didn&rsquo;t nought to be neither, and John an&rsquo;
      me can&rsquo;t allow it, not anyhow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest turned scarlet with shame, but could say nothing. Edie only
      whispered softly, &lsquo;Dear, dear Mrs. Halliss, we&rsquo;re so sorry,
      but we can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘'Elp it, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mrs. Halliss, herself almost crying,
      &lsquo;nor there ain&rsquo;t no reason why you should try to &lsquo;elp it
      neither. As I says to John, &ldquo;John,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t
      no &lsquo;arm in it, noways,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t stand
      by,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and see them two poor dear young creechurs,&rdquo;
      meanin&rsquo; no offence, ma&rsquo;am, &ldquo;a-pawning of their own
      jewelry and things to go and pay for their Sunday&rsquo;s dinner.&rdquo;
      And John, &lsquo;e says, says &lsquo;e, &ldquo;Quite right, Martha,&rdquo;
      says &lsquo;e; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let &lsquo;em, my dear,&rdquo; says
      &lsquo;e. &ldquo;The Lord has prospered us a bit in our ‘umble way,
      Martha,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e, &ldquo;and we ain&rsquo;t got no cause to
      want, we ain&rsquo;t; and if the dear lady and the good gentleman wouldn&rsquo;t
      take it as a liberty,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e, &ldquo;it &lsquo;ud be better
      they should just borrer a pound or two for a week from us,&rdquo; says
      &lsquo;e, beggin&rsquo; your pardon, ma&rsquo;am, for &lsquo;intin&rsquo;
      of it, &ldquo;than that there Mr. Le Breting, as ain&rsquo;t accustomed to
      such places nohow, should go a-makin&rsquo; acquaintance, for the fust
      time of his life, as you may say, with the inside of a pawnbroker&rsquo;s
      shop,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      my belief the lady and gentleman &lsquo;ud be insulted,&rdquo; says I,
      &ldquo;though they ARE the sweetest unassoomin&rsquo;est young gentlefolk
      I ever did see,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if we were to go as tin&rsquo; them
      to accept the loan of money from the likes of you and me, John, as is no
      better, by the side of them, nor old servants, in the manner o&rsquo;
      speakin&rsquo;.&rdquo; &ldquo;Insulted,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e; &ldquo;not a
      bit of it, they needn&rsquo;t, Martha,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e, &ldquo;for I
      knows the ways of the aristocracy,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e, &ldquo;and I
      knows as there&rsquo;s many a gentleman as owns &lsquo;is own &lsquo;osses
      and ‘is own &lsquo;ounds as isn&rsquo;t afraid to borrer a pound or so
      from &lsquo;is own coachman, or even from &lsquo;is own groom&mdash;not
      but what to borrer from a groom is lowerin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e,
      &ldquo;in a tempory emergency. Mind you, Martha,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e,
      &ldquo;a tempory emergency is a thing as may &lsquo;appen to landed
      gentlefolks any day,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a
      &lsquo;ole in your coat made by a tear,&rdquo; says &lsquo;e; &ldquo;a
      haccident as may &lsquo;appen to-morrer to the Prince of Wales &lsquo;isself
      upon the &lsquo;untin&rsquo; field,&rdquo; &lsquo;e says. &ldquo;Well,
      then, John,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go an&rsquo; speak to
      &lsquo;em about it, this very minnit,&rdquo; says I, and if I might make
      so bold, ma&rsquo;am, without seemin&rsquo; too presumptious, I should be
      very glad if you&rsquo;d kindly allow me, ma&rsquo;am, to lend Mr. Le
      Breting a few suvverins till ‘e gets &lsquo;is next remittances, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie looked at Ernest, and Ernest looked at Edie and the landlady; and
      then they all three burst out crying together without further apology.
      Perhaps it was the old Adam left in Ernest a little; but though he could
      stand kindness from Dr. Greatrex or from Mr. Lancaster stoically enough,
      he couldn&rsquo;t watch the humble devotion of those two honest-hearted
      simple old servants without a mingled thrill of shame and tenderness.
      &lsquo;Mrs. Halliss,&rsquo; he said, catching up the landlady&rsquo;s hard
      red hand gratefully in his own, &lsquo;you are too good and too kind, and
      too considerate for us altogether. I feel we have done nothing to deserve
      such great kindness from you. But I really don&rsquo;t think it would be
      right of us to borrow from you when we don&rsquo;t even know how long it
      may be before we&rsquo;re able to return your money or whether we shall
      ever be able to return it at all. We&rsquo;re so much obliged to you, so
      very very much obliged to you, dear Mrs. Halliss, but I think we ought as
      a matter of duty to pawn these few little things rather than run into debt
      which we&rsquo;ve no fair prospect at present of ever redeeming.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘HAS you please, sir,&rsquo; Mrs. Halliss said gently, wiping her eyes
      with her snow-white apron, for she saw at once that Ernest really meant
      what he said. &lsquo;Not that John an&rsquo; me would think of it for a
      minnit, sir, so long as you wouldn&rsquo;t mind our takin&rsquo; the
      liberty; but any&rsquo;ow, sir, we can&rsquo;t allow you to go out
      yourself and go to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. It ain&rsquo;t no fit place for
      the likes of you, sir, a pawnbroker&rsquo;s ain&rsquo;t, in all that low
      company; and I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d rightly know &lsquo;ow much
      to hask on the articles, neither. John, &lsquo;e ain&rsquo;t afeard of
      goin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; &lsquo;e says, &lsquo;e insists upon it as ‘e&rsquo;s
      to go, for &lsquo;e don&rsquo;t think, sir, for the honour of the &lsquo;ouse,
      ‘e says, sir, as a lodger of ours ought to be seen a-goin&rsquo; to the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s. Just you give them things right over to John, sir, and
      &lsquo;e&rsquo;ll get you a better price on &lsquo;em by a long way nor
      they&rsquo;d ever think of giving a gentleman like you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest fought off the question in a half-hearted fashion for a little
      while, but Mrs. Halliss insisted upon it, and after a short time Ernest
      gave way, for to say the truth he had very vague ideas himself as to how
      he ought to proceed in a pawnbroking expedition. Mrs. Halliss ran down the
      kitchen stairs quickly, for fear he should change his mind as soon as her
      back was turned, and called out gaily to her husband in the first delight
      of her unexpected triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘John,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;&mdash;drat that man, where is &lsquo;e?
      John, dear, you just putt your &lsquo;at on, and purtend to run round the
      corner a bit to Aston&rsquo;s the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. The Lord have mercy
      upon me for the stories I&rsquo;ve been a-tellin&rsquo; of &lsquo;em, but
      I couldn&rsquo;t bear to see them two pore things a-pawnin&rsquo; their
      little bits of jewelry and sich, and Mr. Le Breting, too, &lsquo;im as ain&rsquo;t
      fit to go knockin&rsquo; together with underbred folks like pawnbrokers.
      So I told &lsquo;im as you&rsquo;d take ‘em round and pawn &lsquo;em for
      &lsquo;im yourself; not as I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ve never pawned
      nothink in your &lsquo;ole life, John, leastways not since ever you an&rsquo;
      me kep&rsquo; company, for afore that I suppose you was purty much like
      other young men is, John, for all you shakes your &lsquo;ead at it now so
      innocent like. But you just run round, there&rsquo;s a dear, and make as
      if you was goin&rsquo; to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, and then you come
      straight &lsquo;ome again unbeknown to &lsquo;em. I ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo;
      to let them two pore dears go pawnin&rsquo; their things for a dinner
      nohow. You take them two suvverins out of your box, John, and putt away
      these &lsquo;ere little things for the present time till the pore souls is
      able to pay us, and if they never don&rsquo;t, small matter neither. Now
      you go fast, John, there&rsquo;s a dear, and come back, and mind you give
      them two suvverins to Mr. Le Breting as natural like as ever you&rsquo;re
      able.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pawn &lsquo;em,&rsquo; John said in a pitying voice, &lsquo;no indeed, it
      ain&rsquo;t come to that yet, I should &lsquo;ope, that they need go
      a-pawnin&rsquo; their effects while we&rsquo;ve got a suvverin or two laid
      by in our box, Martha. Not as anybody need be ashamed of pawnin&rsquo; on
      occasions, for that matter,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say as a reg&rsquo;lar
      thing, but now an&rsquo; then on occasions, as you may call it; for even
      in the best dookal families, I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;eard tell they DO sometimes
      &lsquo;ave to pawn the dimonds, so that pawnin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t in the
      runnin&rsquo; noways, bless you, as respects gentility. Not as I&rsquo;d
      like to go into a pawnshop myself, Martha, as I&rsquo;ve always been
      brought up respectable; but when you send for Mr. Hattenborough to your
      own ressydence and say quite commandin&rsquo; like, &ldquo;&lsquo;Er Grace
      &lsquo;ud be obleeged if you&rsquo;d wait upon &lsquo;er in Belgrave
      Square to hinspeck &lsquo;er dimonds as I want to raise the wind on
      &lsquo;em,&rdquo; why, that&rsquo;s quite another matter nat&rsquo;rally.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When honest John came back in a few minutes and handed the two sovereigns
      over to Ernest, he did it with such an unblushing face as might have won
      him applause on any stage for its perfect naturalness. &lsquo;Lor&rsquo;
      bless your &lsquo;eart, sir,&rsquo; he said in answer to Ernest&rsquo;s
      shamefaced thanks, touching the place where his hat ought to be
      mechanically, &lsquo;it ain&rsquo;t nothing, sir, that ain&rsquo;t. If it
      weren&rsquo;t for the dookal families of England, sir, it&rsquo;s my
      belief the pawnbrokin&rsquo; business wouldn&rsquo;t be worth mentioning
      in the manner o&rsquo; speakin&rsquo;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, Ernest paced up and down the little parlour rather moodily
      for half an hour with three words ringing perpetually in his dizzy
      ears-the &lsquo;Never, never, never,&rsquo; he had used so short a tune
      since about the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence.&rsquo; He must get money
      somehow for Dot and Edie! he must get money somehow to pay good Mrs.
      Halliss for their board and lodging! There was only one way possible.
      Fight against it as he would, in the end he must come back to that
      inevitable conclusion. At last he sat down with a gloomy face at the
      centre table, and pulled out a sheet of blank foolscap.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What are you going to do, Ernest?&rsquo; Edie asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest groaned. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m writing a social for the &ldquo;Morning
      Intelligence,&rdquo; Edie,&rsquo; he answered bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Ernest!&rsquo; Edie said with a face of horror and surprise. &lsquo;Not
      after the shameful way they&rsquo;ve treated poor Max Schurz!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest groaned again. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else to be done, Edie,&rsquo;
      he said, looking up at her despondently. &lsquo;I must earn money somehow
      to keep the house going.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the business of the truthful historian to narrate facts, not to
      palliate or extenuate the conduct of the various actors. Whether Ernest
      did right or wrong, at least he did it; he wrote a playful social for
      Monday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Morning Intelligence,&rsquo; and carried it into the
      office on Sunday afternoon himself, because there was no postal delivery
      in the London district.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, he lay awake once more for hours together, tossing and
      turning, and reflecting bitterly on his own baseness and his final moral
      downfall. Herbert was right, after all. The environment was beginning to
      conquer. He could hold out no longer. Herr Max was in prison; the world
      was profoundly indifferent; he himself had fallen away like Peter; and
      there was nothing left for him now but to look about and find himself a
      dishonourable grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dot? And Edie? What was to become of them after? Ah me, for the pity
      of it when a man cannot even crawl quietly into a corner and die in peace
      like a dog, without being tortured by fears and terrors beforehand as to
      what will come to those he loves far better than life when he himself is
      quietly dead and buried out of the turmoil!

      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; A MAN AND A MAID.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IF Ernest and Edie had permitted it, Ronald Le Breton would have gone at
      once, after his coming of age, to club income and expenditure with his
      brother&rsquo;s household. But, as Edie justly remarked, when he proposed
      it, such a course would pretty nearly have amounted to clubbing HIS income
      with THEIR expenditure; and even in their last extreme of poverty that was
      an injustice which neither she nor her husband could possibly permit.
      Ronald needed all his little fortune for his own simple wants, and though
      they themselves starved, they couldn&rsquo;t bear to deprive him of the
      small luxuries which had grown into absolute necessaries for one so feeble
      and weak. Indeed, ill as Ernest himself now was, he had never outgrown the
      fixed habit of regarding Ronald as the invalid of the family; and to have
      taken anything, though in the direst straits, from him, would have seemed
      like robbing the helpless poor of their bare necessities. So Ronald was
      fain at last to take lodgings for himself with a neighbour of good Mrs.
      Halliss&rsquo;s, and only to share in Ernest&rsquo;s troubles to the small
      extent of an occasional loan, which Edie would have repaid to time if she
      had to go without their own poor little dinner for the sake of the
      repayment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Ronald had another interest on hand which to his enthusiastic
      nature seemed directly imposed upon him by the finger of Providence&mdash;to
      provide a home and occupation for poor Selah, whom Herbert had cast aside
      as a legacy to him. As soon as he had got settled down to his own new mode
      of life in the Holloway lodgings, he began to look about for a fit place
      for the homeless girl&mdash;a place, he thought to himself, which must
      combine several special advantages; plenty of work&mdash;she wanted that
      to take her mind off brooding; good, honest, upright people; and above
      all, no religion. Ronald recognised that last undoubted requirement as of
      absolutely paramount importance. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll stand any amount of
      talk or anything else from me,&rsquo; he said to himself often, &lsquo;because
      she knows I&rsquo;m really in earnest; but she wouldn&rsquo;t stand it for
      a moment from those well-meaning, undiscriminating, religious busy-bodies,
      who are so awfully anxious about other people&rsquo;s souls, though they
      never seem for a single minute to consider in any way other people&rsquo;s
      feelings.&rsquo; After a little careful hunting among his various
      acquaintances, however, he found at last a place that would exactly suit
      Selah at a stationer&rsquo;s in Netting Hill; and there he put her&mdash;with
      full confidence that Selah would do the work entrusted to her well and
      ably, if not from conscientiousness, at least from personal pride, &lsquo;which,
      after all,&rsquo; Roland soliloquised dreamily, ‘is as good a substitute
      for the genuine article as one can reasonably expect to find in poor
      fallen human nature.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wish, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; Selah said, quite timidly for her (maidenly
      reserve, it must be admitted, was not one of Selah Briggs&rsquo;s strong
      points), &lsquo;that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be quite so far from you as
      Notting Hill. If I could see you sometimes, you know, I should feel that
      it might keep me more straight&mdash;keep me away from the river in
      future, I mean. I can&rsquo;t stand most people&rsquo;s preaching, but
      somehow, your preaching seems to do me more good than harm, really, which
      is just the exact opposite way, it seems to me, from everybody else&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald smiled sedately. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you want to see me
      sometimes,&rsquo; he said, with a touch of something very like gallantry
      in his tone that was wholly unusual with him. &lsquo;I shall walk over
      every now and then, and look you up at your lodgings over yonder; and
      besides, you can come on Sundays to dear Edie&rsquo;s, and I shall be able
      to meet you there once a fortnight or thereabouts. But I&rsquo;m not going
      to let you call me Mr. Le Breton any longer; it isn&rsquo;t friendly: and,
      what&rsquo;s more, it isn&rsquo;t Christian. Why should there be these
      artificial barriers between soul and soul, eh, Selah? I shall call you
      Selah in future: it seems more genuine and heartfelt, and unencumbered
      with needless conventions, than your misters and misses. After all, why
      should we keep up such idle formalities between brethren and
      fellow-workers?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah started a little&mdash;she knew better than Ronald himself did what
      such first advances really led to. &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Le Breton,&rsquo; she
      said quickly, &lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t call you Ronald. I can never
      call any other man by his Christian name as long as I live, after&mdash;your
      brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You mistake me, Selah,&rsquo; Ronald put in hastily, with his quaint
      gravity. &lsquo;I mean it merely as a sign of confidence and a mark of
      Christian friendship. Sisters call their brothers by their Christian
      names, don&rsquo;t they? So there can be no harm in that, surely. It seems
      to me that if you call me Mr. Le Breton, you&rsquo;re putting me on the
      footing of a man merely; if you call me Ronald, you&rsquo;re putting me on
      the footing of a brother, which is really a much more harmless and
      unequivocal position for me to stand in. Do, please, Selah, call me
      Ronald.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Selah answered. &lsquo;I daren&rsquo;t.
      I mustn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; But she faltered a little for a moment,
      notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You must, Selah,&rsquo; Ronald said, with all the force of his
      enthusiastic nature, fixing his piercing eyes full upon her. &lsquo;You
      must, I tell you. Call me Ronald.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very well&mdash;Ronald,&rsquo; Selah said at last, after a long pause.
      ‘Good-bye, now. I must be going. Good-bye, and thank you. Thank you. Thank
      you.&rsquo; There was a tear quivering even in Selah Briggs&rsquo;s eye,
      as she held his hand lingeringly a moment in hers before releasing it. He
      was a very good fellow, really, and he had been so very kind, too, in
      interesting himself about her future.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What a marvellous thread of sameness,&rsquo; Ronald thought to himself,
      as he walked back rapidly to his solitary lodgings, &lsquo;runs through
      the warp and woof of a single family, after all! What an underlying unity
      of texture there must be throughout, in all its members, however outwardly
      dissimilar they may seem to be from one another! One would say at first
      sight there was very little, if anything, in common between me and
      Herbert. And yet this girl interests me wonderfully. Of course I&rsquo;m
      not in love with her&mdash;the notion of MY falling in love with anybody
      is clearly too ridiculous. But I&rsquo;m attracted by her, drawn towards
      her, fascinated as it were; I feel a sort of curious spell upon me
      whenever I look into her deep big eyes, flashing out upon one with their
      strange luminousness. It isn&rsquo;t merely that the Hand has thrown her
      in my way: that counts for something, no doubt, but not for everything.
      Besides, the Hand doesn&rsquo;t act blindly&mdash;nay, rather, acts with
      supreme wisdom, surpassing the powers or the comprehension of man. When it
      threw Selah Briggs in my way, depend upon it, it was because the Infinite
      saw in me something that was specially adapted to her, and in her
      something that was specially adapted to me. The instrument is duly shaped
      by inscrutable Wisdom for its own proper work. Now, whatever interests ME
      in her, must have also interested Herbert in her equally and for the same
      reason. We&rsquo;re drawn towards her, clearly; she exercises over both of
      us some curious electric power that she doesn&rsquo;t exercise,
      presumably, over other people. For Herbert must have been really in love
      with her&mdash;not that I&rsquo;m in love with her, of course; but still,
      the phenomena are analogous, even if on a slightly different plane&mdash;Herbert
      must have been really in love with her, I&rsquo;m sure, or such a prudent
      man as he is would never have let himself get into what he would consider
      such a dangerous and difficult entanglement. Yes, clearly, there&rsquo;s
      something in Selah Briggs that seems to possess a singular polarity, as
      Ernest would call it, for the Le Breton character and individuality!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And then, it cuts both ways, too, for Selah was once desperately in love
      with Herbert: of that I&rsquo;m certain. She must have been, to judge from
      the mere strength of the final revulsion. She&rsquo;s a girl of intensely
      deep passions&mdash;I like people to have some depth to their character,
      even if it&rsquo;s only in the way of passion&mdash;and she&rsquo;d never
      have loved him at all without loving him fervently and almost wildly: hers
      is a fervent, wild, indomitable nature. Yes, she was certainly in love
      with Herbert; and now, though of course I don&rsquo;t mean to say she&rsquo;s
      in love with me (I hope it isn&rsquo;t wrong to think in this way about an
      unmarried girl), still I can&rsquo;t help seeing that I have a certain
      influence over her in return&mdash;that she pays much attention to what I
      say and think, considers me a person worth considering, which she doesn&rsquo;t
      do, I&rsquo;m sure, with most other people. Ah, well, there&rsquo;s a vast
      deal of truth, no doubt, in these new hereditary doctrines of Darwin&rsquo;s
      and Galton&rsquo;s that Herbert and Ernest talk about so much; a family&rsquo;s
      a family, that&rsquo;s certain, not a mere stray collection of casual
      acquaintances. How the likeness runs through the very inmost structure of
      our hearts and natures! I see in Selah very much what Herbert saw in
      Selah: Selah sees in me very much what she saw in Herbert. Extraordinary
      insight into human nature men like Darwin and Galton have, to be sure? And
      David, too, what a marvellous thinker he was, really! What unfathomed
      depths of meaning lie unexpected in that simple sentence of his, &ldquo;I
      am fearfully and wonderfully made.&rdquo; Fearfully and wonderfully,
      indeed, when one remembers that from one father and mother Herbert and I
      have both been compounded, so unlike in some things that we scarcely seem
      to be comparable with one another (look at Herbert&rsquo;s splendid
      intellect beside mine!), so like in others that Selah Briggs&mdash;goodness
      gracious, what am I thinking of? I was just going to say that Selah Briggs
      falls in love first with one of us and then with the other. I do hope and
      trust it isn&rsquo;t wrong of me to fill my poor distracted head so much
      with these odd thoughts about that unfortunate girl, Selah!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; THE ENVIRONMENT FINALLY TRIUMPHS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Winter had come, and on a bitter cold winter&rsquo;s night, Ernest Le
      Breton once more received an unexpected telegram asking him to hurry down
      without a moment&rsquo;s delay on important business to the ‘Morning
      Intelligence&rsquo; office. The telegram didn&rsquo;t state at all what
      the business was; it merely said it was urgent and immediate without in
      any way specifying its nature. Ernest sallied forth in some perturbation,
      for his memories of the last occasion when the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence&rsquo;
      required his aid on important business were far from pleasant ones; but
      for Edie&rsquo;s sake he felt he must go, and so he went without a murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sit down, Le Breton,&rsquo; Mr. Lancaster said slowly when Ernest
      entered. &lsquo;The matter I want to see you about&rsquo;s a very peculiar
      one. I understand from some of my friends that you&rsquo;re a son of Sir
      Owen Le Breton, the Indian general.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I am,&rsquo; Ernest answered, wondering within himself to what end
      this curious preamble could possibly be leading up. If there&rsquo;s any
      one profession, he thought, which is absolutely free from the slightest
      genealogical interest in the persons of its professors, surely that
      particular calling ought to be the profession of journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, so I hear, Le Breton. Now, I believe I&rsquo;m right in saying, am
      I not, that it was your father who first subdued and organised a certain
      refractory hill-tribe on the Tibetan frontier, known as the Bodahls, wasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite right,&rsquo; Ernest replied, with a glimmering idea slowly rising
      in his mind as to what Mr. Lancaster was now driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, that&rsquo;s good, very good indeed, certainly. Well, tell me, Le
      Breton, do you yourself happen to know anything on earth about these
      precious insignificant people?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know all about them,&rsquo; Ernest answered quickly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      read all my father&rsquo;s papers and despatches, and seen his maps and
      plans and reports in our house at home from my boyhood upward. I know as
      much about the Bodahls, in fact, as I know about Bayswater, or Holborn, or
      Fleet Street.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Capital, capital,&rsquo; the editor said, fondling his big hands softly;
      ‘that&rsquo;ll exactly suit us. And could you get at these plans and
      papers now, this very evening, just to refresh the gaps in your memory?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I could have them all down here,&rsquo; Ernest answered, &lsquo;at an
      hour&rsquo;s notice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good,&rsquo; the editor said again. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send a boy for them
      with a cab. Meanwhile, you&rsquo;d better be perpending this telegram from
      our Simla correspondent, just received. It&rsquo;s going to be the
      question of the moment, and we should very much like you to give us a
      leader of a full column about the matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest took the telegram and read it over carefully. It ran in the usual
      very abbreviated newspaper fashion: &lsquo;Russian agents revolted Bodahls
      Tibetan frontier. Advices Peshawur state Russian army marching on Merv.
      Bodahls attacked Commissioner, declared independence British raj.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you write us a leader?&rsquo; the editor asked, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest drew a long breath. Three guineas! Edie, Dot, an empty exchequer!
      If he could only have five minutes to make his mind up! But he couldn&rsquo;t.
      After all, what did it matter what he said about these poor unknown
      Bodahls? If HE didn&rsquo;t write the leader, somebody else who knew far
      less about the subject than he did would be sure to do it. He wasn&rsquo;t
      responsible for that impalpable entity &lsquo;the policy of the paper.&rsquo;
      Beside the great social power of the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence,&rsquo;
      of the united English people, what was he, Ernest Le Breton, but a
      miserable solitary misplaced unit? One way or the other, he could do very
      little indeed, for good or for evil. After half a minute&rsquo;s internal
      struggle, he answered back the editor faintly, &lsquo;Yes, I will.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;For Edie,&rsquo; he muttered half audibly to himself; &lsquo;I must
      do it for dear Edie.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And you&rsquo;ll allow me to make whatever alterations I think necessary
      in the article to suit the policy of the paper?&rsquo; the editor asked
      once more, looking through him with his sleepy keen grey eyes. ‘You see,
      Le Breton, I don&rsquo;t want to annoy you, and I know your own principles
      are rather peculiar; but of course all we want you for is just to give us
      the correct statement of facts about these outlandish people. All that
      concerns our own attitude towards them as a nation falls naturally under
      the head of editorial matter. You must see yourself that it&rsquo;s quite
      impossible for us to let any one single contributor dictate from his own
      standpoint the policy of the paper.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest bent his head slowly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very kind to argue out
      the matter with me so, Mr. Lancaster,&rsquo; he said, trembling with
      excitement. ‘Yes, I suppose I must bury my scruples. I&rsquo;ll write a
      leader about these Bodahls, and let you deal with it afterwards as you
      think proper.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They showed him into the bare little back room, and sent a boy up with a
      hastily written note to Ronald for the maps and papers. There Ernest sat
      for an hour or two, writing away for very life, and putting on paper
      everything that he knew about the poor Bodahls. By two o&rsquo;clock, the
      proofs had all come up to him, and he took his hat in a shamefaced manner
      to sally out into the cold street, where he hoped to hide his rising
      remorse and agony under cover of the solitary night. He knew too well what
      &lsquo;the policy of the paper&rsquo; would be, to venture upon asking any
      questions about it. As he left the office, a boy brought him down a sealed
      envelope from Mr. Lancaster. With his usual kindly thoughtfulness the
      editor had sent him at once the customary cheque for three guineas. Ernest
      folded it up with quivering fingers, and felt the blood burn in his cheeks
      as he put it away in his waistcoat pocket. That accursed money! For it he
      had that night sold his dearest principles! And yet, not for it, not for
      it, not for it&mdash;oh, no, not for it, but for Dot and Edie!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had a duplicate proof in his other hand, and Ernest saw at once
      that it was his own leader, as altered and corrected by Mr. Lancaster. He
      asked the boy whether he might see it; and the boy, knowing it was Ernest&rsquo;s
      own writing, handed it to him at once without further question. Ernest did
      not dare to look at it then and there for fear he should break down
      utterly before the boy; he put it for the moment into his inner pocket,
      and buttoned his thin overcoat tightly around him. It was colder still in
      the frosty air of early morning, and the contrast to the heated atmosphere
      of the printing house struck him with ominous chill as he issued slowly
      forth into the silent precincts of unpeopled Fleet Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a terrible memorable night, that awful Tuesday; the coldest night
      known for many years in any English winter. Snow lay deep upon the ground,
      and a few flakes were falling still from the cloudy sky, for it was in the
      second week of January. The wind was drifting it in gusty eddies down the
      long streets, and driving the drifts before it like whirling dust in an
      August storm. Not a cab was to be seen anywhere, not even a stray hansom
      crawling home from clubs or theatres; and Ernest set out with a rueful
      countenance to walk as best he might alone through the snow all the way to
      Holloway. It is a long and dreary trudge at any time; it seemed very long
      and dreary indeed to Ernest Le Breton, with his delicate frame and weak
      chest, battling against the fierce wind on a dark and snowy winter&rsquo;s
      night, and with the fever of a great anxiety and a great remorse silently
      torturing his distracted bosom. At each step he took through the snow, he
      almost fancied himself a hunted Bodahl. Would British soldiers drive those
      poor savage women and children to die so of cold and hunger on their snowy
      hilltops? Would English fathers and mothers, at home at their ease,
      applaud the act with careless thoughtlessness as a piece of our famous
      spirited foreign policy? And would his own article, written with his own
      poor thin cold fingers in that day&rsquo;s &lsquo;Morning Intelligence,&rsquo;
      help to spur them on upon that wicked and unnecessary war? What right had
      we to conquer the Bodahls? What right had we to hold them in subjection or
      to punish them for revolting? And above all, what right had he, Ernest Le
      Breton, upon whose head the hereditary guilt of the first conquest ought
      properly to have weighed with such personal heaviness&mdash;what right had
      he, of all men, directly or indirectly, to aid or abet the English people
      in their immoral and inhuman resolve? Oh, God, his sin was worse than
      theirs; for they sinned, thinking they did justly; but as for him, he
      sinned against the light; he knew the better, and, bribed by gold, he did
      the worse. At that moment, the little slip of printed paper in his
      waistcoat pocket seemed to burn through all the frosts of that awful
      evening like a chain of molten steel into his very marrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Trudging on slowly through the white stainless snow, step by step,&mdash;snow
      that cast a sheet of pure white even over the narrow lanes behind the
      Farringdon Road,&mdash;cold at foot and hot at heart, he reached at last
      the wide corner by the Angel at Islington. The lights in the windows were
      all out long ago, of course, but the lamps outside were still flaring
      brightly, and a solitary policeman was standing under one of them, trying
      to warm his frozen hands by breathing rapidly on the curved and distorted
      fingers. Ernest was very tired of his tramp by that time, and emboldened
      by companionship he stopped awhile to rest himself in the snow and wind
      under the opposite lamplight. Putting his back against the post, he drew
      the altered proof of his article slowly out of his inner pocket. It had a
      strange fascination for him, and yet he dreaded to look at it. With an
      effort, he unfolded it in his stiff fingers, and held the paper up to the
      light, regardless of the fact that the policeman was watching his
      proceedings with the interest naturally due from a man of his profession
      to a suspicious-looking character who was probably a convicted pickpocket.
      The first sentence once more told him the worst. There was no doubt at all
      about it. The three guineas in his pocket were the price of blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The insult to British prestige in the East,&rsquo; ran that terrible
      opening paragraph, &lsquo;implied in the brief telegram which we publish
      this morning from our own Correspondent at Simla, calls for a speedy and a
      severe retribution. It must be washed out in blood.&rsquo; Blood, blood,
      blood! The letters swam before his eyes. It was this, then, that he, the
      disciple of peace-loving Max Schurz, the hater of war and conquest, the
      foe of unjust British domination over inferior races&mdash;it was this
      that he had helped to make plausible with his special knowledge and his
      ready pen! Oh, heaven, what reparation could he make for this horrid crime
      he had knowingly and wilfully committed? What could he do to avoid the
      guilt of those poor savages&rsquo; blood upon his devoted head? In one
      moment he thought out a hundred scenes of massacre and pillage&mdash;scenes
      such as he knew only too well always precede and accompany the blessings
      of British rule in distant dependencies. The temptation had been strong&mdash;the
      money had been sorely wanted&mdash;there was very little food in the
      house; but how could he ever have yielded to such a depth of premeditated
      wickedness! He folded the piece of paper into his pocket once more, and
      buried his face in his hands for a whole minute. The policeman now began
      to suspect that he was not so much a pickpocket as an escaped lunatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he was, no doubt. Of course we who are practical men of the world
      know very well that all this foolish feeling on Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s
      part was very womanish and weak and overwrought; that he ought to have
      done the work that was set before him, asking no questions for conscience&rsquo;
      sake; and that he might honestly have pocketed the three guineas, letting
      his supposed duty to a few naked brown people somewhere up in the Indian
      hill-country take care of itself, as all the rest of us always do. But
      some allowance must naturally be made for his peculiar temperament and for
      his particular state of health. Consumptive people are apt to take a
      somewhat hectic view of life in every way; they lack the common-sense
      ballast that makes most of us able to value the lives of a few hundred
      poor distant savages at their proper infinitesimal figure. At any rate,
      Ernest Le Breton, as a matter of fact, rightly or wrongly, did take this
      curious standpoint about things in general; and did then and there turn
      back through the deep snow, all his soul burning within him, fired with
      dire remorse, and filled only with one idea&mdash;how to prevent this
      wicked article to which he had contributed so many facts and opinions from
      getting printed in to-morrow&rsquo;s paper. True, it was not he who had
      put in the usual newspaper platitudes about the might of England, and the
      insult to the British flag, and the immediate necessity for a stern
      retaliation; but all that vapouring wicked talk (as he thought it) would
      go forth to the world fortified by the value of his special facts and his
      obviously intimate acquaintance with the whole past history of the Bodahl
      people. So he turned back and battled once more with the wind and snow as
      far as Fleet Street; and then he rushed excitedly into the &lsquo;Morning
      Intelligence&rsquo; office, and asked with the wildness of despair to see
      the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lancaster had gone home an hour since, the porter said; but Mr. Wilks,
      the sub-editor, was still there, superintending the printing of the paper,
      and if Ernest liked, Mr. Wilks would see him immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest nodded assent at once, and was forthwith ushered up into Mr. Wilks&rsquo;s
      private sanctum. The sub-editor was a dry, grizzly-bearded man, with a
      prevailing wolfish greyness of demeanour about his whole person; and he
      shook Ernest&rsquo;s proffered hand solemnly, in the dreary fashion that
      is always begotten of the systematic transposition of night and day.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Wilks,&rsquo; Ernest cried imploringly,
      &lsquo;I want to know whether you can possibly suppress or at least alter
      my leader on the Bodahl insurrection!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilks looked at him curiously, as one might look at a person who had
      suddenly developed violent symptoms of dangerous insanity. ‘Suppress the
      Bodahl leader,&rsquo; he said slowly like one dreaming. ‘Suppress the
      Bodahl leader! Impossible! Why, it&rsquo;s the largest type heading in the
      whole of to-day&rsquo;s paper, is this Bodahl business. &ldquo;Shocking
      Outrage upon a British Commissioner on the Indian Frontier. Revolt of the
      Entire Bodahl Tribe. Russian Intrigue in Central Asia. Dangerous Position
      of the Viceroy at Simla.&rdquo; Oh, dear me, no; not to have a leader upon
      THAT, my dear sir, would be simply suicidal!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But can&rsquo;t you cut out my part of it, at least,&rsquo; Ernest said
      anxiously. &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Wilks, you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve
      suffered to-night on account of this dreadful unmerited leader. It&rsquo;s
      wicked, it&rsquo;s unjust, it&rsquo;s abominable, and I can&rsquo;t bear
      to think that I have had anything to do with sending it out into the world
      to inflame the passions of unthinking people! Do please try to let my part
      of it be left out, and only Mr. Lancaster&rsquo;s, at least, be printed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilks looked at him again with the intensest suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A sub-editor,&rsquo; he answered evasively, &lsquo;has nothing at all to
      do with the politics of a paper. The editor alone manages that department
      on his own responsibility. But what on earth would you have me do? I can&rsquo;t
      stop the machines for half an hour, can I, just to let you have the chance
      of doctoring your leader? If you thought it wrong to write it, you ought
      never to have written it; now it&rsquo;s written it must certainly stand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest sank into a chair, and said nothing; but he turned so deadly pale
      that Mr. Wilks was fain to have recourse to a little brown flask he kept
      stowed away in a corner of his desk, and to administer a prompt dose of
      brandy and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, there,&rsquo; he said, in the kindest manner of which he was
      capable, &lsquo;what are you going to do now? You can&rsquo;t be going out
      again in this state and in this weather, can you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I am,&rsquo; Ernest answered feebly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to walk
      home at once to Holloway.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To Holloway!&rsquo; the sub-editor said in a tone of comparative horror.
      &lsquo;Oh! no, I can&rsquo;t allow that. Wait here an hour or two till the
      workmen&rsquo;s trains begin running. Or, stay; Lancaster left his
      brougham here for me to-night, as I have to be off early to-morrow on
      business; I&rsquo;ll send you home in that, and let Hawkins get me a cab
      from the mews by order.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest made no resistance; and so the sub-editor sent him home at once in
      Lancaster&rsquo;s brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got home in the early grey of morning, he found Edie still sitting
      up for him in her chair, and wondering what could be detaining him so long
      at the newspaper office. He threw himself wildly at her feet, and, in such
      broken sentences as he was able to command, he told her all the pitiful
      story. Edie soothed him and kissed him as he went along, but never said a
      word for good or evil till he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It was a terrible temptation, darling,&rsquo; she said softly: &lsquo;a
      terrible temptation, indeed, and I don&rsquo;t wonder you gave way to it;
      but we mustn&rsquo;t touch the three guineas. As you say rightly, it&rsquo;s
      blood-money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest drew the cheque slowly from his pocket, and held it hesitatingly a
      moment in his hand. Edie looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What are you going to do with it, darling?&rsquo; she asked in a low
      voice, as he gazed vacantly at the last dying embers in the little
      smouldering fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing, Edie dearest,&rsquo; Ernest answered huskily, folding it up and
      putting it away in the drawer by the window. They neither of them dared to
      look the other in the face, but they had not the heart to burn it boldly.
      It was blood-money, to be sure; but three guineas are really so very
      useful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later, little Dot was taken with a sudden illness. Ernest and
      Edie sat watching by her little cradle throughout the night, and saw with
      heavy hearts that she was rapidly growing feebler. Poor wee soul, they had
      nothing to keep her for: it would be better, perhaps, if she were gone;
      and yet, the human heart cannot be stifled by such calm deliverances of
      practical reason; it WILL let its hot emotions overcome the cold
      calculations of better and worse supplied it by the unbiassed intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long they sat there tearfully, fearing she would not live till
      morning; and in the early dawn they sent round hastily for a neighbouring
      doctor. They had no money to pay him with, to be sure; but that didn&rsquo;t
      much matter; they could leave it over for the present, and perhaps some
      day before long Ernest might write another social, and earn an honest
      three guineas. Anyhow, it was a question of life and death, and they could
      not help sending for the doctor, whatever difficulty they might afterwards
      find in paying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came, and looked with the usual professional seriousness at the
      baby patient. Did they feed her entirely on London milk? he asked
      doubtfully. Yes, entirely. Ah! then that was the sole root of the entire
      mischief. She was very dangerously ill, no doubt, and he didn&rsquo;t know
      whether he could pull her through anyhow; but if anything would do it, it
      was a change to goat&rsquo;s milk. There was a man who sold goat&rsquo;s
      milk round the corner. He would show Ernest where to find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest looked doubtfully at Edie, and Edie looked back again at Ernest.
      One thought rose at once in both their minds. They had no money to pay for
      it with, except&mdash;except that dreadful cheque. For four days it had
      lain, burning a hole in Ernest&rsquo;s heart from its drawer by the
      window, and he had not dared to change it. Now he rose without saying a
      word, and opened the drawer in a solemn, hesitating fashion. He looked
      once more at Edie inquiringly; Edie nodded a faint approval. Ernest, pale
      as death, put on his hat, and went out totteringly with the doctor. He
      stopped on the way to change the cheque at the baker&rsquo;s where they
      usually dealt, and then went on to the goat&rsquo;s milk shop. How that
      sovereign he flung upon the counter seemed to ring the knell of his
      seif-respect! The man who changed it noticed the strangeness of Ernest&rsquo;s
      look, and knew at once he had not come by the money honestly. He rang it
      twice to make sure it was good, and then gave the change to Ernest. But
      Dot, at least, was saved; that was a great thing. The milk arrived duly
      every morning for some weeks, and, after a severe struggle, Dot grew
      gradually better. While the danger lasted, neither of them dared think
      much of the cheque; but when Dot had got quite well again, Ernest was
      conscious of a certain unwonted awkwardness of manner in talking to Edie.
      He knew perfectly well what it meant; they were both accomplices in crime
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ernest wrote his &lsquo;social&rsquo; after Max Schurz&rsquo;s
      affair, he felt he had already touched the lowest depths of degradation.
      He knew now that he had touched a still lower one. Oh! horrible abyss of
      self-abasement!&mdash;he had taken the blood-money. And yet, it was to
      save Dot&rsquo;s life! Herbert was right, after all: quite right. Yes,
      yes, all hope was gone: the environment had finally triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the awful self-reproach of that deadly remorse for the acceptance of
      the blood-money, Ernest Le Breton felt at last in his heart that surely
      the bitterness of death was past. It would be better for them all to die
      together than to live on through such a life of shame and misery. Ah,
      Peter, Peter, you are not the only one that has denied his Lord and
      Master!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, Ernest Le Breton had only written part of a newspaper leader
      about a small revolt of the Bodahls. And he suffered more agony for it
      than many a sensitive man, even, has suffered for the commission of some
      obvious crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I say, Berkeley,&rsquo; Lancaster droned out in the lobby of their club
      one afternoon shortly afterwards, &lsquo;what on earth am I ever to do
      about that socialistic friend of yours, Le Breton? I can&rsquo;t ever give
      him any political work again, you know. Just fancy! first, you remember, I
      set him upon the Schurz imprisonment business, and he nearly went mad then
      because I didn&rsquo;t back up Schurz for wanting to murder the Emperor of
      Russia. After that, just now the other day, I tried him on the Bodahl
      business, and hang me if he didn&rsquo;t have qualms of conscience about
      it afterwards, and trudge back through all the snow that awful Tuesday, to
      see if he couldn&rsquo;t induce Wilks to stop the press, and let him cut
      it all out at the last moment! He&rsquo;s as mad as a March hare, you
      know, and if it weren&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m really sorry for him I wouldn&rsquo;t
      go on taking socials from him any longer. But I will; I&rsquo;ll give him
      work as long as he&rsquo;ll do it for me on any terms; though, of course,
      it&rsquo;s obviously impossible under the circumstances to let him have
      another go at politics, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You&rsquo;re really awfully kind, Lancaster,&rsquo; Berkeley answered
      warmly. ‘No other fellow would do as much for Le Breton as you do. I admit
      he&rsquo;s absolutely impracticable, but I would give more than I can tell
      you if only I thought he could be made to pull through somehow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Impracticable!&rsquo; the editor said shortly, &lsquo;I believe you,
      indeed. Why, do you remember that ridiculous Schurz business? Well, I sent
      Le Breton a cheque for eight guineas for that lot, and can you credit it,
      it&rsquo;s remained uncashed from that day to this. I really think he must
      have destroyed it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No doubt,&rsquo; Arthur answered, with a smile. &lsquo;And the Bodahls?
      What about them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! he kept that cheque for a few days uncashed&mdash;though I&rsquo;m
      sure he wanted money at the time; but in the end, I&rsquo;m happy to say,
      he cashed it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s countenance fell ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He did!&rsquo; he said gloomily. &lsquo;He cashed it! That&rsquo;s bad
      news indeed, then. I must go and see them to-morrow morning early. I&rsquo;m
      afraid they must be at the last pitch of poverty before they&rsquo;d
      consent to do that. And yet, Solomon says, men do not despise a thief if
      he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. And Le Breton, after all,
      has a wife and child to think of.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lancaster stared at him blankly, and turned aside to glance at the
      telegrams, saying to himself meanwhile, that all these young fellows of
      the new school alike were really quite too incomprehensible for a
      sensible, practical man like himself to deal with comfortably.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; DE PROFUNDIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After all Ernest didn&rsquo;t get many more socials to write for the
      ‘Morning Intelligence,&rsquo; as it happened; for the war that came on
      shortly after crowded such trifles as socials fairly out of all the
      papers, and he had harder work than ever to pick up a precarious living
      somehow by the most casual possible contributions. Of course he tried many
      other channels; but he had few introductions, and then his views were
      really so absurdly ultra that no reasonable editor could ever be expected
      to put up with them. He got tired at last of seeing his well-meant papers
      return to him, morning after morning, with the unvarying legend, &lsquo;Declined
      with thanks;&rsquo; and he might have gone to the wall utterly but for the
      kindly interest which Arthur Berkeley still took in his and Edie&rsquo;s
      future. On the very day after his conversation with Lancaster at the club
      Arthur dropped round casually at Holloway, and brought with him a proposal
      which he said had just been made him by a colonial newsagent. It was a
      transparent little ruse enough; but Ernest and Edie were not learned in
      the ways of the world and did not suspect it so readily as older and wiser
      heads might probably have done. Would Ernest supply a fortnightly letter,
      to go by the Australian mail, to the Paramatta ‘Chronicle and News,&rsquo;
      containing London political and social gossip of a commonplace kind&mdash;just
      the petty chit-chat he could pick up easily out of &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; and
      the &lsquo;World&rsquo;&mdash;for the small sum of thirty shillings a
      letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Ernest thought he could manage that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, then. The letter must be sent on alternate Wednesdays to the
      colonial newsagent&rsquo;s address, and it would be duly forwarded by mail
      to the office of the Paramatta &lsquo;Chronicle.&rsquo; A little
      suspicious, that item, Berkeley thought, but Ernest swallowed it like a
      child and made no comment. It must be addressed to &lsquo;Paramatta, care
      of Lane &amp; Co.,&rsquo; and the payments would be made fortnightly
      through the same agency. Arthur watched his friend&rsquo;s face narrowly
      at this point again; but Ernest in his simple-minded, unsuspecting way,
      never noticed the obvious meaning of this little deception. He thanked
      Arthur over and over again for his kindness, but he never guessed how far
      it extended. The letters kept him employed for two days a week, or
      thereabouts, and though they never got to Paramatta, nor any farther than
      Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s own study in the little house he had taken for
      himself at Chelsea, they were regularly paid for through the colonial
      newsagents, by means of a cheque which really owed its ultimate origin to
      Arthur Berkeley himself. Fifteen shillings a week is not a large fortune,
      certainly; but still it is considerably better than nothing, when you come
      to try both methods of living by practical experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, however, Ernest and Edie had a hard struggle, with their habits
      of life and Ernest&rsquo;s delicate health, to make both ends meet upon
      that modest income. They found the necessity for recourse to the imaginary
      pawnbroker growing upon them with alarming rapidity; and though the few
      small articles that they sent out for that purpose never really went
      beyond kind Mrs. Halliss&rsquo;s kitchen dresser, yet so far as Ernest and
      Edie were concerned, the effect was much the same as if they had been
      really pledged to the licensed broker. The good woman hid them away
      carefully in the back drawers of the dresser, sending up as much money for
      the poor little trinkets as she thought it at all credible that any man in
      his senses could possibly advance&mdash;if she had given altogether too
      much, she thought it probable that even the unsuspicious Le Bretons would
      detect the kindly deception&mdash;at the time remarking to John that
      &lsquo;if ever them pore dear young creechurs was able to redeem &lsquo;em
      again, why, well an&rsquo; good; an&rsquo; if not, why, they could just
      find some excuse to give &lsquo;em back to the dear lady after pore Mr. Le
      Breting was dead an&rsquo; gone, as he must be, no doubt, afore many
      months was over.&rsquo; What wretched stuff that is that some
      narrow-minded cynics love to talk, after their cheap moralising fashion,
      about the coldness and cruelty of the world! The world is not cold and
      cruel; it is brimming over everywhere with kindliness and warmth of heart;
      and you have only got to put yourself into the proper circumstances in
      order to call forth at once on every hand, and in all classes, its
      tenderest and truest sympathies. None but selfish, unsympathetic people
      themselves ever find it otherwise in the day of trouble. It is not the
      world that is cold and heartless&mdash;it is not the individual members of
      the world that are cruel and unkind&mdash;it is the relentless march of
      circumstances&mdash;the faulty organisation which none of us can control,
      and for which none of us is personally responsible, that grinds us to
      powder under its Juggernaut wheels. Private kindliness is for ever trying,
      feebly and unsuccessfully, but with its best efforts, to undo the evil
      that general mismanagement is for ever perpetrating in its fateful course.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, a few weeks later, Arthur Berkeley called in again, and on the
      stairs he met a child playing&mdash;a neighbour&rsquo;s child whom good
      Mrs. Halliss allowed to come in and amuse herself while the mother went
      out charing. The girl had a bright gold object in her hand; and Arthur,
      wondering how she came by it, took it from her and looked at it curiously.
      He recognised it in a moment for what it was&mdash;a gold bracelet, a well
      remembered gold bracelet&mdash;the very one that he himself had given as a
      wedding present to poor Edie. He turned it over and looked closely at the
      inside: cut into the soft gold he saw the one word &lsquo;Frustra,&rsquo;
      that he himself had carved into it with his penknife the night before the
      memorable wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Where did you get this?&rsquo; he asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs. &lsquo;Alliss give it me,&rsquo; the little one answered, beginning
      to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur ran lightly down the steps again, and knocked at the door of Mrs.
      Halliss&rsquo;s kitchen, with the tell-tale bracelet in his hand. Mrs.
      Halliss opened the dcor to him respectfully, and after a faint attempt at
      innocent prevarication, felt bound to let out all the pitiful little
      secret without further preamble. So Arthur, good, kind-hearted,
      delicate-souled Arthur, took his seat sadly upon one of the hard wooden
      kitchen chairs, and waited patiently while Mrs. Halliss and honest John,
      in their roundabout inarticulate fashion, slowly unfolded the story how
      them two pore young creechurs upstairs had been druv that low through want
      of funs that Mrs. Le Breting, God bless &lsquo;er &lsquo;eart, &lsquo;ad
      &lsquo;ad to pawn her poor little bits of jewelry and such like: and how
      they &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ad the face to go an&rsquo; pawn it for
      her, and so &lsquo;ad locked it up in their drawers, and waited hopefully
      for better times. Arthur listened to all this with an aching heart, and
      went home alone to ponder on the best way of still further assisting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing that occurred to him was a plan for giving Edie, too, a
      little relief, in the way of what she might suppose to be money-getting
      occupation. She used to paint a little in water-colours, he remembered, in
      the old days; so he put an advertisement in a morning paper, which he got
      Mrs. Halliss to show Edie, asking for drawings of orchids, the flowers to
      be supplied and accurately copied by an amateur at a reasonable price.
      Edie fell into the harmless friendly trap readily enough, and was duly
      supplied with orchids by a florist in Regent Street, who professed to
      receive his instructions from the advertiser. The pictures were all
      produced in due time, and were sent to a fixed address, where a gentleman
      in a hansom used to call for them at regular intervals. Arthur Berkeley
      kept those poor little water-colours long afterwards locked up in a
      certain drawer all by themselves: they were sacred mementoes to him of
      that old hopeless love for the little Miss Butterfly of his Oxford days.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the very first three guineas that Edie earned, carefully saved and
      hoarded out of her payments for the water-colours, she insisted in the
      pride of her heart that Ernest should go and visit a great London
      consulting physician. Sir Antony Wraxall was the best specialist in town
      on the subject of consumption, she had heard, and she was quite sure so
      clever a man must do Ernest a great deal of good, if he didn&rsquo;t even
      permanently cure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s no use, Edie darling,&rsquo; Ernest said to her imploringly.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll only be wasting your hard-earned money. What I want is
      not advice or medicine; I want what no doctor on earth can possibly give
      me&mdash;relief from this terrible crushing responsibility.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Edie would bear no refusal. It was HER money, she said, the first she
      had ever earned in her whole life, and she should certainly do as she
      herself liked with it. Sir Antony Wraxall, she was quite confident, would
      soon be able to make him better.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ernest, overborne by her intreaties, yielded at last, and made an
      appointment with Sir Antony Wraxall. He took his quarter-hour in due form,
      and told the great physician all his symptoms as though he believed in the
      foolish farce. Sir Antony held his head solemnly on one side, weighed him
      with puritanical scrupulosity to a quarter of an ounce on his delicate
      balance, listened attentively at the chest with his silver-mounted
      stethoscope, and perpended the net result of his investigation with
      professional gravity; then he gave Edie his full advice and opinion to the
      maximum extent of five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your husband&rsquo;s case is not a hopeful one, Mrs. Le Breton,&rsquo; he
      said solemnly, &lsquo;but still, a great deal may be done for him.&rsquo;
      Edie&rsquo;s face brightened visibly. &lsquo;With care, his life may be
      prolonged for many years,&mdash;I may even say, indeed, quite
      indefinitely.&rsquo; Edie smiled with joy and gratitude. &lsquo;But you
      must strictly observe my rules and directions&mdash;the same that I&rsquo;ve
      just given in a similar case to the Crown Prince of Servia who was here
      before you. In the first place, your husband must give up work altogether.
      He must be content to live perfectly and absolutely idle. Then, secondly,
      he must live quite away from England. I should recommend the Engadine in
      summer, and Algeria or the Nile trip every winter; but, if that&rsquo;s
      beyond your means&mdash;and I understand from Mr. Le Breton that you&rsquo;re
      in somewhat straitened circumstances&mdash;I don&rsquo;t object to
      Catania, or Malaga, or even Mentone and the Riviera. You can rent
      furnished villas for very little on the Riviera. But he must in no case
      come farther north, even in summer, than the Lake of Geneva. That, I
      assure you, is quite indispensable, if he wishes to live another
      twelvemonth. Take him south at once, in a coupé-lit of course, and break
      the journey once or twice at Lyons and Marseilles. Next, as to diet, he
      must live generously&mdash;very generously. Don&rsquo;t let him drink
      claret; claret&rsquo;s poor sour stuff; a pint of good champagne daily, or
      a good, full-bodied, genial vintage Burgundy would be far better and more
      digestible for him. Oysters, game, sweetbreads, red mullet, any little
      delicacy of that sort as much as possible. Don&rsquo;t let him walk; let
      him have carriage exercise daily; you can hire carriages for a mere trifle
      monthly at Cannes and Mentone. Above all things, give him perfect freedom
      from anxiety. Allow him to concentrate his whole attention on the act of
      getting well, and you&rsquo;ll find he&rsquo;ll improve astonishingly in
      no time. But if you keep him here in England and feed him badly and
      neglect my directions, I can&rsquo;t answer for his getting through
      another winter....Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself, I beg of you; don&rsquo;t,
      pray, give way to tears; there is really no occasion for it, my dear
      madam, no occasion for it at all, if you&rsquo;ll only do as I tell
      you....Quite right, thank you. Good morning.&mdash;Next case, McFarlane.&mdash;Good
      morning. Good morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was the end of weeping little Edie&rsquo;s poor hardly-spared
      three guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next day Arthur Berkeley happened to mount the stairs quietly, at
      an earlier hour than usual, and knocked at the door of Ernest&rsquo;s
      lodging. There was no answer, so he turned the handle, and entered by
      himself. The remains of breakfast lay upon the table. Arthur did not want
      to spy, but he couldn&rsquo;t help remarking that these remains were
      extremely meagre and scanty. Half a loaf of bread stood upon a solitary
      plate in the centre; a teapot and two cups occupied one side; and&mdash;that
      was all. In spite of himself, he couldn&rsquo;t restrain his curiosity,
      and he looked more closely at the knives and plates. Not a mark of
      anything but crumbs upon them, not even butter! He looked into the cups.
      Nothing but milkless tea at the bottom! Yes, the truth was only too
      evident; they had had no meat for breakfast, no butter, no milk, no sugar;
      it was quite clear that the meal had consisted entirely of dry bread with
      plain tea&mdash;call it hot water&mdash;and that for a dying man and a
      delicate over-worked lady! Arthur looked at that pitiable breakfast-table
      with a twinge of remorse, and the tears rose sharply and involuntarily
      into his eyes. He had not done enough for them, then; he had not done
      enough for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Miss Butterfly! and had it really come to this! You, so
      bright, so light, so airy, in want, in positive want, in hunger even, with
      your good, impossible, impracticable Ernest! Had it come to this! Bread
      and water; dry bread and water! Down tears, down; a man must be a man;
      but, oh, what a bitter sight for Arthur Berkeley! And yet, what could he
      do to mend it? Money they would not take; he dare not even offer it; and
      he was at his wit&rsquo;s end for any other contrivance for serving them
      without their knowledge. He must do what he could; but how he was to do
      it, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there, ruminating bitterly over that poor bare table, he
      thought he heard sounds above, as of Edie coming downstairs with Dot on
      her shoulder. He knew she would not like to know that he had surprised the
      secret of their dire poverty; and he turned silently and cautiously to
      descend the stair. There was only just time enough to get away, for Edie
      was even then opening the door of the nursery. Noiselessly, with cat-like
      tread, he crept down the steps once more, and heard Edie descending, and
      singing as she came down to Dot. It was a plaintive little song, in a sad
      key&mdash;a plaintive little song of his own&mdash;but not wholly
      distressful, Arthur thought; she could still sing, then, to her baby! With
      the hot tears rising a second time to his eyes, he groped his way to the
      foot of the staircase. There he brushed them hurriedly aside with his
      hand, and turned out into the open street. The children were playing and
      tumbling in the sun, and a languid young man in a faultless frock coat and
      smooth silk hat was buying a showy button-hole flower from the little
      suburban florist&rsquo;s opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy heart Arthur Berkeley turned homeward to his own cosy little
      cottage; that modest palace of art which he had once hoped little Miss
      Butterfly might have shared with him. He went up the steps, and turned
      quickly into his own small study. The Progenitor was there, sitting
      reading in an easy-chair. &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; Arthur thought to
      himself, &lsquo;I have made HIS old age happy. If I could only do as much
      for little Miss Butterfly! for little Miss Butterfly! for little Miss
      Butterfly! If I could only do as much for her, oh, how happy and contented
      I should be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung himself down on his own sofa, and brushed big eyes nervously with
      his handkerchief before he dared lookup again towards the Progenitor.
      &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; he said, clutching his watchchain hard and playing
      with it nervously to keep down his emotion, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid those
      poor Le Bretons are in an awfully bad way. I&rsquo;m afraid, do you know,
      that they actually haven&rsquo;t enough to eat! I went into their rooms
      just now, and, would you believe it, I found nothing on the table for
      breakfast but dry bread and tea!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Progenitor looked up quietly from the volume of Morley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Voltaire&rsquo;
      which he was at that moment placidly engaged in devouring. &lsquo;Nothing
      but dry bread and tea,&rsquo; he said, in what seemed to Arthur a horribly
      unconcerned tone. &lsquo;Really, hadn&rsquo;t they? Well, I dare say they
      ARE very badly off, poor people. But after all, you know, Artie, they can&rsquo;t
      be really poor, for Le Breton told me himself he was generally earning
      fifteen shillings or a pound a week, and that, you see, is really for
      three people a very good income, now isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur, delicate-minded, gentle, chivalrous Arthur, gazed in surprise and
      sudden distress at that dear, good, unselfish old father of his. How
      extraordinary that the kindly old man couldn&rsquo;t grasp the full horror
      of the situation! How strange that he, who would himself have been so
      tender, so considerate, so womanly in his care and sympathy towards
      anything that seemed to him like real poverty or real suffering, should
      have been so blinded by his long hard workingman life towards the peculiar
      difficulties and trials of classes other than his own as not to recognise
      the true meaning of that dreadful disclosure! Arthur was not angry with
      him&mdash;he felt too fully at that moment what depths of genuine silent
      hardship uncomplainingly endured were implied in the stoically calm frame
      of mind which could treat Edie Le Breton&rsquo;s penury of luxuries as a
      comparatively slight matter: after all, his father was right at bottom;
      such mere sentimental middle-class poverty is as nothing to the privations
      of the really poor; yet he could not help feeling a little disappointed
      for all that. He wanted sympathy in his pity, and he could clearly expect
      none here. &lsquo;Why, father,&rsquo; he cried bitterly, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t
      throw yourself into the position as you ought to do. A pound a week, paid
      regularly, would be a splendid income of course for people brought up like
      you or me. But just consider how those two young people have been brought
      up! Consider their wants and their habits! Consider the luxury they have
      been accustomed to! And then think of their being obliged to want now
      almost for food in their last extremity!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His father answered in the same quiet tone&mdash;not hardly, but calmly,
      as though he were discussing a problem in political economy instead of the
      problem of Edie Le Breton&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;&lsquo;Well, you see, it&rsquo;s
      all a matter of the standard of comfort. These two friends of yours have
      been brought up above their future; and now that they&rsquo;re got to come
      down to their natural level, why, of course, they feel it, depend upon it,
      they feel it. Their parents, of course, shouldn&rsquo;t have accustomed
      them to a style of life above their station. Good dry bread, not too
      stale, does nobody any harm: still, I dare say they don&rsquo;t like
      coming down to it. But bless your heart, Artie, if you&rsquo;d seen the
      real want and poverty that I&rsquo;ve seen, my boy&mdash;the actual hunger
      and cold and nakedness that I&rsquo;ve known honest working people brought
      down to by no work, and nothing but the House open before them, or not
      that even, you wouldn&rsquo;t think so much of the sentimental grievances
      of people who are earning fifteen shillings a week in ease and comfort.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, Father,&rsquo; Arthur went on, scarcely able to keep down the rising
      tone of indignation at such seeming heartlessness, &lsquo;Ernest doesn&rsquo;t
      earn even that always. Sometimes he earns nothing, or next to nothing; and
      it&rsquo;s the uncertainty and insecurity that tells upon them even more
      than the poverty itself. Oh, Father, Father, you who have always been so
      good and kind, I never heard you speak so cruelly about anyone before as
      you&rsquo;re speaking now about that poor, friendless, helpless,
      penniless, heart-broken little woman!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old shoemaker caught at the word suddenly, and looking him through and
      through with an unexpected gleam of discovery, laid down the life of
      Voltaire on the table with a bang, and sat straight upright in his chair,
      nodding his head, and muttering slowly to himself, &lsquo;Little woman&mdash;he
      said &ldquo;little woman!&rdquo; Poor Artie, Poor Artie!&rsquo; in a tone
      of inexpressible pity. At last he turned to Arthur and cried with a voice
      of womanly tenderness, &lsquo;My boy, my boy, I didn&rsquo;t know before
      it was the lassie you were thinking of; I thought it was only poor young
      Le Breton. I see it all now; I&rsquo;ve surprised your secret; you&rsquo;ve
      let it out to me without knowing it. Oh, Artie, if that&rsquo;s She, I&rsquo;m
      sorry for her, and I&rsquo;m sorry for you, my boy, from the bottom of my
      heart. If that&rsquo;s She, Artie, we&rsquo;ll put our heads together, and
      see what plan we can manage to save her from what she has never been
      accustomed to. Don&rsquo;t think too hardly of your old Progenitor, Artie;
      he hasn&rsquo;t mixed with these people all his life, and learned to
      sympathise with them as you&rsquo;ve done, my son; he doesn&rsquo;t
      understand them or know their troubles as you do: but if that&rsquo;s her
      that you told me about one day, we shall find the means to make her happy
      and comfortable yet, if we have to starve for it. Dear Arthur, do not
      think I could be harsh or unfeeling for a moment to the woman that you
      ever once in passing fixed your heart upon. Let&rsquo;s talk it over and
      think it over, and sooner or later we&rsquo;ll surely find the way to
      accomplish it.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; PRECONTRACT OF MARRIAGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whether Ronald Le Breton&rsquo;s abstruse speculations on the theory of
      heredity were well founded or not, it certainly did happen, at any rate,
      that the more he saw of Selah Briggs the better he liked her; and the more
      Selah saw of him the better she liked him in return. Curiously enough,
      too, Selah did actually recognise in him what he fancied he recognised in
      himself, that part of his brother&rsquo;s nature (not all wholly assumed)
      which was just what Selah had first been drawn to admire in Herbert
      himself. It wasn&rsquo;t merely the originality of his general point of
      view: it was something more deep-seated and undefinable than that&mdash;in
      a word, his idiosyncrasy. Selah Briggs, with her peculiar fiery soul and
      rebellious nature, found in both the Le Bretons something that seemed at
      once to satisfy her wants, to fulfil her desires, to saturate her
      affinities: and with Ronald, as with Herbert before, she was conscious of
      a certain awe and respect which was all the more pleasant to her because
      her untamed spirit had never felt anything like it with any other human
      being. She didn&rsquo;t understand them, and she didn&rsquo;t want to
      understand them: that constituted just the very charm of their whole
      personality to her peculiar fancy. All the other people she had ever met
      were as transparent as glass, for good or for evil; she could see through
      all their faults and virtues as easily as one sees through a window: the
      Le Bretons were to her inscrutable, novel, incomprehensible, inexplicable,
      and she prized them for their very inscrutability. And so it came to pass,
      that almost by a process of natural and imperceptible transference, she
      passed on at last to Ronald&rsquo;s account very much the same intensity
      of feeling that she had formerly felt towards his brother Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the same time, Selah never for a moment let him see it. She was too
      proud to confess now that she could ever love another man: the Mr. Walters
      she had once believed in had never, never, never existed: and she would
      raise no other idol in future to take the place of that vanished ideal.
      She was grateful to Ronald, and even fond of him: but that was
      all-outwardly at least. She never let him see, by word or act, that in her
      heart of hearts she was beginning to love him. And yet Ronald
      instinctively knew it. He himself could not have told you why; but he knew
      it. Even a woman cannot hide a secret from a man with that peculiarly
      penetrating intuitive temperament which belongs to sensitive, delicate
      types like Ronald Le Breton&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday evening, when Selah had been spending a few hours at Edie&rsquo;s
      lodgings (Ronald always made it an excuse for finding them a supper, on
      the ground that Selah was really his guest, though he could not
      conveniently ask her to his own rooms), he walked home towards Notting
      Hill with Selah; and as they crossed the Regent&rsquo;s Park, he took the
      opportunity to say something to her that he had had upon his mind for a
      few weeks past, in some vague, indefinite, half-unconscious fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Selah,&rsquo; he began, a little timidly, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s
      very probable we shan&rsquo;t have Ernest here much longer with us?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid it is, Ronald,&rsquo; Selah answered. She had got quite
      accustomed now to calling him Ronald. With such a poor, weak, sickly
      fellow as that, why really, after all, it did not much matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Selah,&rsquo; Ronald went on, gravely, his eyes filling with tears
      as he spoke, &lsquo;in that case, you know, I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s
      to become of poor Edie. It&rsquo;s a dreadful contingency to talk about,
      Selah, and I can&rsquo;t bear talking about it; but we MUST face these
      things, however terrible, mustn&rsquo;t we? and in this case one&rsquo;s
      absolutely bound to face it for poor Edie&rsquo;s sake as well as for
      Ernest&rsquo;s. Selah, she must have a home to go to, when dear Ernest&rsquo;s
      taken from us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m very sorry for her, Ronald,&rsquo; Selah answered, with unusual
      softness of manner, &lsquo;but I really don&rsquo;t see how a home can
      possibly be provided for her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do,&rsquo; Ronald answered, more calmly; &lsquo;and for their sakes,
      Selah, I want you to help me in trying to provide it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How?&rsquo; Selah asked, looking up in his face curiously, as they passed
      into a ray of lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Listen, Selah, and I&rsquo;ll tell you. Why, by marrying me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never?&rsquo; Selah answered, firmly, and with a decided tinge of the old
      Adam in her trembling voice. &lsquo;Never, Ronald! Never, never, never!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Wait a minute, Selah,&rsquo; Ronald pleaded, &lsquo;till you&rsquo;ve
      heard the end of what I have to say to you. Consider that when dear Ernest&rsquo;s
      gone (oh! Selah, you must excuse me; it makes me cry so to think of it),
      there&rsquo;ll be nowhere on earth for poor little Edie and Dot to go to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Did ever a man propose to a girl so extraordinarily in all this world,&rsquo;
      Selah thought to herself, angrily. &lsquo;He actually expects me to marry
      him in order to provide a home for his precious sister-in-law. That&rsquo;s
      really carrying unselfishness a step too far, I call it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Edie couldn&rsquo;t come and live with me, of course,&rsquo; Ronald went
      on, quickly, &lsquo;if I were a bachelor; but if I were married, why then,
      naturally, she and Dot could come and live with us; and she could earn a
      little money somehow, no doubt; and, at any rate, it&rsquo;d be better for
      her than starvation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah stopped a minute, and tapped the hard ground two or three times
      angrily with the point of her umbrella. &lsquo;And me, Ronald?&rsquo; she
      said in a curious defiant voice. &lsquo;And ME? I suppose you&rsquo;ve
      forgotten all about ME. You don&rsquo;t ask me to marry you because you
      love me; you don&rsquo;t ask me whether I love you or not; you only
      propose to me that I should quietly turn domestic housekeeper for Mrs.
      Ernest Le Breton. And for my part, I answer you plainly, once for all,
      that I&rsquo;m not going to do it&mdash;no, never, never, never!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke haughtily, flashing her eyes at him in the fierce old fashion,
      and Ronald was almost frightened at the angry intensity of her
      contemptuous gestures. &lsquo;Selah,&rsquo; he cried, trying to take her
      hand, which she tore away from him hurriedly: &lsquo;Selah, you
      misunderstand me. I only approached the subject that way because I didn&rsquo;t
      want to seem overweening and presumptuous. It&rsquo;s a very great piece
      of vanity, it seems to me, for any man to ask a woman whether she loves
      him. I&rsquo;m too conscious of all my own faults and failings, Selah, to
      venture upon asking you ever to love me; but I do love you, Selah, I&rsquo;m
      sure I do love you; and I hoped, I somehow fancied&mdash;it may have been
      mere fancy, but I DID imagine&mdash;that I detected, I can&rsquo;t say
      how, that you did really love me, too, just a very very little. Oh, Selah,
      it&rsquo;s because I really love you that I ask you whether you&rsquo;ll
      marry me, such as I am; I know I&rsquo;m a poor sort of person to marry,
      but I ventured to hope you might love me just a little for all that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked so frail and gentle as he stood there pleading in the pale
      moonlight, that Selah could have taken him to her bosom then and there and
      fondled him as one would pet a sick child, for pure womanliness; but the
      devil in her blood kept her from doing it, and she answered haughtily,
      instead: &lsquo;Ronald, if you wanted to marry me, you ought to have asked
      me for my own sake. Now that you&rsquo;ve asked me for another&rsquo;s,
      you can&rsquo;t expect me to give you an answer. Keep your money, my poor
      boy; you&rsquo;ll want it all for you and her hereafter; don&rsquo;t go
      sharing it and spending it on perfect strangers such as me. And don&rsquo;t
      go talking to me again about this business as long as your sister-in-law
      is unprovided for. I&rsquo;m not going to take the bread out of her mouth,
      and I&rsquo;m not going to marry a man who doesn&rsquo;t utterly and
      entirely love me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I do,&rsquo; Ronald answered, earnestly; &lsquo;I do, Selah; I love
      you truly and faithfully from the very bottom of my heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Leave off, Roland,&rsquo; Selah said in the same angry tone. &lsquo;If
      you ever talk to me of this again, I give you my word of honour about it,
      I&rsquo;ll never speak another word to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ronald, who deeply respected the sanctity of a promise, were it only a
      threat, bided his time, and said no more about it for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, as Ronald sat reading in his own rooms, he was much surprised at
      hearing a well-known voice at the door, inquiring with some asperity
      whether Mr. Le Breton was at home. He listened to the voice in intense
      astonishment. It was his mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ronald,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton began, the moment she had been shown into
      his little sitting-room, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think, after your
      undutiful, ungrateful conduct&mdash;with that abominable woman, too&mdash;that
      I should ever have come to see you, unless you came first, as you ought
      clearly to do, and begged my pardon penitently for your disgraceful
      behaviour. It&rsquo;s hard, I know, to acknowledge oneself in the wrong,
      but every Christian ought to be above vindictiveness and obstinate
      self-will; and I expect you, therefore, sooner or later, to come and ask
      forgiveness for your dreadful unkindness to me. Till then, as I said, I
      didn&rsquo;t expect to call upon you in any way. But I&rsquo;ve felt
      compelled to-day to come and speak to you about a matter of duty, and as a
      matter of duty strictly I regard it, not as any relaxation of my just
      attitude of indignant expectancy towards yourself; no parent ought rightly
      to overlook such conduct as yours on the part of a son.&rsquo; Ronald
      inclined his head respectfully. ‘Well, what I&rsquo;ve come to speak to
      you about to-day, Ronald, is about your poor misguided brother Ernest. He,
      too, as you know, has behaved very badly to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,&rsquo; Ronald answered stoutly, without further note or comment.
      Where the matter touched himself only he could maintain a decent silence,
      but where it touched poor dying Ernest he couldn&rsquo;t possibly restrain
      himself, even from a sense of filial obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very badly to me,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton went on sternly, without in any
      way noticing the brief interruption, &lsquo;and I can&rsquo;t, of course,
      go to see him either, especially not as I should by so doing expose myself
      to meeting the person whom he has chosen to make his wife. Still, as I
      hear that Ernest a in a very serious or even dangerous condition&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He&rsquo;s dying,&rsquo; Ronald answered, the quick tears once more
      finding the easy road to his eyes as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I considered, as a mother, it was my duty to warn him to take a little
      thought about his soul.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘His soul!&rsquo; Ronald exclaimed in astonishment. &lsquo;Ernest&rsquo;s
      soul! Why, mother, dear Ernest has no need to look after his soul. He
      doesn&rsquo;t take that sordid, petty, limited view of our relations with
      eternity, and of our relations with the Infinite, which makes them all
      consist of the miserable, selfish, squalid desire to save our own poor
      personal little souls at all hazards. Ernest has something better and
      nobler to think of, I can assure you, than such a mere self-centred idea
      as that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ronald!&rsquo; Lady Breton exclaimed, drawing herself up with much
      dignity; &lsquo;how on earth you, who have always pretended to be a
      religious person, can utter such a shocking and wicked sentiment as that,
      really passes my comprehension. What in the world is religion for, I
      should like to know, if it isn&rsquo;t to teach us how to save our own
      souls? But the particular thing I want to speak to you about is just this:
      couldn&rsquo;t you manage to induce Ernest to see the Archdeacon a little,
      and let the Archdeacon speak to him about his deplorable spiritual
      condition? I thought about you both so much at church yesterday, when the
      dear Archdeacon was preaching such a beautiful sermon; his text was like
      this, as far as I can remember it. &ldquo;There is a way that seemeth
      right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.&rdquo; I
      couldn&rsquo;t help thinking all the time of my own two poor rebellious
      boys, and of the path that their misguided notions were leading them on.
      For I believe Ernest does really somehow persuade himself that he&rsquo;s
      in the right&mdash;it&rsquo;s inconceivable, but it&rsquo;s the fact; and
      I&rsquo;m afraid the end thereof will be the ways of death; and then, as
      the dear Archdeacon said, &ldquo;After death the judgment.&rdquo; Oh,
      Ronald, when I think of your poor dear brother Ernest&rsquo;s open
      unbelief, it makes me tremble for his future, so that I couldn&rsquo;t
      rest upon my bed until I&rsquo;d been to see you and urged you to go and
      try to save him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mother,&rsquo; Ronald said with that tone in which he was well accustomed
      to answering Lady Le Breton&rsquo;s religious harangues; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think you need feel any uneasiness whatever on dear Ernest&rsquo;s
      account, so far as all that&rsquo;s concerned. What does HE want with
      saving his soul, mother? &ldquo;Whosoever will save his life shall lose
      it.&rdquo; Remember what is written: &ldquo;Not every one that saith unto
      me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, Ronald,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton continued, half angrily, &lsquo;consider
      his unbelief, his dreadful opinions, his errors of doctrine! How on earth
      can we be happy about him when we think of those?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t think, Mother,&rsquo; Ronald answered gently, &lsquo;that
      Infinite Justice and Infinite Love take much account of a man&rsquo;s
      opinions. They take account of his life and soul only, not of the
      correctness of his propositions in dogmatic theology; &ldquo;Other sheep
      have I which are not of this fold&mdash;them also must I bring.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It seems to me, Ronald,&rsquo; Lady Le Breton rejoined coldly, &lsquo;that
      you don&rsquo;t in the least care for whatever is most distinctive and
      characteristic in the whole of Christian doctrine. You talk so very very
      differently on religious subjects from that dear, good, excellent
      Archdeacon.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda Tregellis rang the bell resolutely. &lsquo;I shall have no more
      nonsense about it,&rsquo; she said to herself in her most decisive and
      determined manner. &lsquo;Whether mamma wishes it or not, I shall go and
      see them this very day without another word upon the subject.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant answered the bell and stood waiting for his orders by the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Harris, will you tell Jenkins at once that I shall want the carriage at
      half-past eleven?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, my lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All right then. That&rsquo;ll do. Don&rsquo;t stand staring at me there
      like an image, but go this minute and do as I tell you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Beg pardon, my lady, but her ladyship said she wanted the carriage
      herself at twelve puncshual.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She can&rsquo;t have it, then, Harris. That&rsquo;s all. Go and give my
      message to Jenkins at once, and I&rsquo;ll settle about the carriage with
      my lady myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She&rsquo;s the rummest young lady ever I come across,&rsquo; the man
      murmured to himself in a dissatisfied fashion, as he went down the stairs
      again: &lsquo;but there, it&rsquo;s none of my business, thank goodness.
      The places and the people she does go and hunt up when she&rsquo;s got the
      fit on are truly ridic&rsquo;lous: blest if she didn&rsquo;t acshally make
      Mr. Jenkins drive her down into Camberwell the other mornin&rsquo;, to see
      ‘ow the poor lived, she said; as if it mattered tuppence to us in our
      circles of society &lsquo;ow the poor live. I wonder what little game she&rsquo;s
      up to now? Well, well, what the aristocracy is coming to in these days is
      more&rsquo;n I can fathom, as sure as my name&rsquo;s William ‘Arris.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little game that Lady Hilda was up to that morning was one that a
      gentleman in Mr. Harris&rsquo;s position was certainly hardly like to
      appreciate or sympathise with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before, she had met Arthur Berkeley once more at a small At
      Home, and had learned from him full particulars as to the dire straits
      into which the poor Le Bretons had finally fallen. Now, Hilda Tregellis
      was a kind-hearted girl at bottom, and when she heard all about it, she
      said at once to Arthur, &lsquo;I shall go and see them myself to-morrow,
      Mr. Berkeley, whether mamma allows me or not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What good will it do?&rsquo; Arthur had answered her quickly. &lsquo;You
      can&rsquo;t find work for poor Le Breton, can you? and of course if you
      can&rsquo;t do that you can be of no earthly use in any way to the poor
      creatures.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; Hilda responded warmly. &lsquo;Sympathy&rsquo;s
      always something, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Berkeley? Nobody ought to know that
      better than you do. Besides, there&rsquo;s no saying when one may happen
      to turn up useful. Of course, I&rsquo;ve never been of the slightest use
      to anybody in all my life, myself, I know, and I dare say I never shall
      be, but at least there&rsquo;s no harm in trying, is there? I&rsquo;m on
      speaking terms with such an awful lot of people, all of them rich and many
      of them influential&mdash;Parliament, and Government offices, and all that
      sort of nonsense, you know&mdash;people who have no end of things to give
      away, and can&rsquo;t tell who on earth they&rsquo;d better give them to,
      for fear of offending all the others, that I might possibly hear of
      something or other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid, Lady Hilda,&rsquo; Berkeley answered smiling, &lsquo;none
      of those people would have anything to offer that could possibly be of the
      slightest use to poor Le Breton. If he&rsquo;s to be saved at all, he must
      be saved in his own time and by his own methods. For my own part, I don&rsquo;t
      see what conceivable chance of success in life there is left for him. You
      can&rsquo;t imagine a man like him making money and living comfortably. It&rsquo;s
      a tragedy&mdash;all the dramas of real life always ARE tragedies; but I&rsquo;m
      terribly afraid there&rsquo;s no conceivable way out of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda only looked at him with bold good humour. &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo;
      she said bravely. &lsquo;All pure rubbishing pessimistic nonsense. (I hope
      pessimistic&rsquo;s the right word&mdash;it&rsquo;s a very good word,
      anyhow, even if it isn&rsquo;t in the proper place.) Well, I don&rsquo;t
      agree with you at all about this question, Mr. Berkeley. I&rsquo;m very
      fond of Mr. Le Breton, really very fond of him; and I believe there&rsquo;s
      a corner somewhere for every man if only he can jog down properly into his
      own corner instead of being squeezed forcibly into somebody else&rsquo;s.
      The worst of it is, all the holes are round, and Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s a
      square man, I allow: he wants all the angles cutting down off him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But you can&rsquo;t cut them off; that&rsquo;s the very trouble,&rsquo;
      Arthur answered, with just a faint rising suspicion that he was half
      jealous of the interest Hilda showed even in poor lonely Ernest Le Breton.
      Gracious heavens! could he be playing false at last to the long-cherished
      memory of little Miss Butterfly? could he be really beginning to fall just
      a little in love, after all, with this bold beautiful Lady Hilda
      Tregellis? He didn&rsquo;t know, and yet he somehow hardly liked himself
      to think it. And while Edie was still so poor too!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, you can&rsquo;t cut them off; I know that perfectly well,&rsquo;
      Hilda rejoined quickly. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care twopence for him if I
      thought you could. It&rsquo;s the angles that give him all his charming
      delicious originality. But you can look out a square hole for him
      somewhere, you know, and that of course would be a great deal better.
      Depend upon it, Mr. Berkeley, there are square holes up and down in the
      world, if only we knew where to look for them; and the mistake that
      everybody has made in poor Mr. Le Breton&rsquo;s case has been that
      instead of finding one to suit him, they&rsquo;ve gone on trying to poke
      him down anyhow by main force into one of the round ones. That goes
      against the grain, you know; besides which I call it a clear waste of the
      very valuable solid mahogany corners.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Berkeley looked at her silently for a moment, as if a gleam of
      light had burst suddenly in upon him. Then he said to her slowly and
      deliberately, &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right, Lady Hilda, though I
      never thought of it quite in that light before. But one thing certainly
      strikes me now, and that is that you&rsquo;re a great deal cleverer after
      all than I ever thought you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda made a little mock curtsey. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you
      to say so,&rsquo; she answered, half-saucily. &lsquo;Only the compliment
      is rather double-edged, you must confess, because it implies that up to
      now you&rsquo;ve had a dreadfully low opinion of my poor little
      intelligence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So after that conversation Lady Hilda made up her mind that she would
      certainly go the very next day and call as soon as possible upon Edie Le
      Breton. Nobody could tell what good might possibly come of it; but at
      least there could come no harm. And so, when the carriage drew up it the
      door at half-past eleven, Hilda Tregellis stepped into it with a vague
      consciousness of an important mission, and ordered Jenkins to drive at
      once to the side street in Holloway, whose address Arthur Berkeley had
      last night given her. Jenkins touched his hat with mechanical respect, but
      inwardly wondered what the dickens my lady would think if only she came to
      know of these ‘ere extrornary goin&rsquo;s on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the lodgings Hilda alighted and rang the bell herself. Good
      Mrs. Halliss opened the door, and answered quickly that Mrs. Le Breton was
      at home. Her woman&rsquo;s eye detected at once the coronet on the
      carriage, and she was ready to burst with delight when the tall visitor
      handed her a card for Edie, bearing the name of Lady Hilda Tregellis. It
      was almost the first time that Edie had had any lady callers; certainly
      the first time she had had any of such social distinction; and Mrs.
      Halliss made haste to usher her up in due form, and then ran down hastily
      to communicate the good news to honest John, who in his capacity of past
      coachman was already gazing out of the area window with deep interest at
      the carriage and horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, John dear,&rsquo; she cried, with tears of joy in her eyes,
      forgetting in her excitement to drat the man for not being in the back
      kitchen, &lsquo;to think that we should see a carriage an&rsquo; pair like
      that there a-drawin&rsquo; up in front of out own very &lsquo;ouse, and
      Lady ‘Ilder Tergellis, or summat o&rsquo; the sort, a-comin&rsquo; &lsquo;ere
      to see that dear little lady in the parlour, why, it&rsquo;s enough to
      make one&rsquo;s ‘eart burst, nearly, just you see now if it reelly isn&rsquo;t.
      You could a&rsquo; knocked me down with a feather, a&rsquo;most, when that
      there Lady ‘Ilder &lsquo;anded me &lsquo;er curd, and asked so sweet-like
      if Mrs. Le Breting was at &lsquo;ome. Mr. Le Breting&rsquo;s people is
      comin&rsquo; round, you may be sure of it; &lsquo;is mother&rsquo;s a lady
      of title, that much we know for certing; and she wouldn&rsquo;t go and let
      &lsquo;er own flesh an&rsquo; blood die &lsquo;ere of downright poverty,
      as they&rsquo;re like to do and won&rsquo;t let us &lsquo;elp it, pore
      dears, without sendin&rsquo; round to inquire and assist ‘em. Married
      against &lsquo;er will, I understand, from what that dear Mr. Berkeley,
      bless &lsquo;is kind &lsquo;eart, do tell me; not as I can believe ‘e
      married beneath &lsquo;im, no, not no ways; for a sweeter, dearer, nicer
      little lady than our Mrs. Le Breting I never did, an&rsquo; that I tell
      you. Sweeter manners you never did see yourself, John, for all you&rsquo;ve
      lived among the aristocracy: an&rsquo; I always knew &lsquo;is people ‘ud
      come round at last, and do what was right by &lsquo;im. An&rsquo; you may
      depend upon it, John, this &lsquo;ere Lady &lsquo;Ilder&rsquo;s one of his
      relations, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s come round on a message from Lady Le
      Breting, to begin a reconciliation. And though we should be sorry to lose
      &lsquo;em, as ‘as stood by &lsquo;em through all their troubles, I&rsquo;m
      glad to &lsquo;ear it, John, that I am, for I can&rsquo;t a-bear to see
      that dear young fellow a-eatin&rsquo; &lsquo;is life out with care and
      anxiety.&rsquo; And Mrs. Halliss, who had always felt convinced in her own
      mind that Ernest must really be the unacknowledged heir to a splendid
      fortune, began to wipe her eyes violently in her delight at this evident
      realisation of her wildest fancies and wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, upstairs in the little parlour, Edie had risen in some
      trepidation as Mrs. Halliss placed in her hands Lady Hilda Tregellis&rsquo;s
      card. Ernest was out, gone to walk feebly around the streets of Holloway,
      and she hardly knew at first what to say to so unexpected a visitor. But
      Lady Hilda put her almost at her ease at once by coming up to her with
      both her arms outstretched, as to an old friend, and saying, with one of
      her pleasantest smiles:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You must forgive me, Mrs. Le Breton, for never having come to call on you
      before; but I have been long meaning to, and doubting whether you would
      care to see me or not. You know, I&rsquo;m a very old friend of your
      husband&rsquo;s&mdash;he was SO kind to me always when he was down at our
      place in dear old Devonshire. (You&rsquo;re a Devonshire girl yourself,
      aren&rsquo;t you? just as I am. I thought so. I&rsquo;m so glad of it. I
      always get on so well with the dear old Devonshire folk.) Well, I&rsquo;ve
      been meaning to come for ever so long, and putting it off, and putting it
      off, and putting it off, as one WILL put things off, you know, when you&rsquo;re
      not quite sure about them, until last evening. And then our friend, Mr.
      Arthur Berkeley, who knows everybody, talked to me about your husband and
      you, and told me he thought you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my coming to see you,
      for he fancied you hadn&rsquo;t much society up here that you cared for or
      sympathised with: though, of course, I&rsquo;m dreadfully afraid of coming
      to call upon you, because I know you&rsquo;re the sister of that very
      clever Mr. Oswald, whose sad death we were all so sorry to hear about in
      the papers; and naturally, as you&rsquo;ve lived so much with him and with
      Mr. Le Breton, you must be so awfully learned and all that sort of thing,
      and no doubt despise ignorant people like myself dreadfully. But you
      really mustn&rsquo;t despise me, Mrs. Le Breton, because, you see, I haven&rsquo;t
      had all the advantages that you&rsquo;ve had; indeed, the only clever
      people I&rsquo;ve ever met in all my life are your husband and Mr. Arthur
      Berkeley, except, of course, Cabinet ministers and so forth, and they don&rsquo;t
      count, because they&rsquo;re political, and so very old, and solemn, and
      grand, and won&rsquo;t take any notice of us girls, except to sit upon us.
      So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s made me rather afraid to call upon you,
      because I thought you&rsquo;d be quite too much in the higher education
      way for a girl like me; and I haven&rsquo;t got any education at all,
      except in rubbish, as your husband used always to tell me. And now I want
      you to tell me all about Mr. Le Breton, and the baby&mdash;Dot, you call
      her, Mr. Berkeley told me&mdash;and yourself, too; for, though I&rsquo;ve
      never seen you before, I feel, of course, like an old friend of the
      family, having known your husband so very intimately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hilda designedly delivered all this long harangue straight off
      without a break, in her go-ahead, breathless, voluble fashion, because she
      felt sure Edie wouldn&rsquo;t feel perfectly at her ease at first, and she
      wanted to give her time to recover from the first foolish awe of that
      meaningless prefix, Lady. Moreover, Lady Hilda, in spite of her offhand
      manner was a good psychologist, and a true woman: and she had concocted
      her little speech on the spur of the moment with some cleverness, so as
      just to suit her instinctive reading of Edie&rsquo;s small personal
      peculiarities. She saw in a moment that that slight, pale, delicate girl
      was lost in London, far from her own home and surroundings; and that the
      passing allusion to their common Devonshire origin would please and
      conciliate her, as it always does with the clannish, warm-hearted,
      simple-minded West Country folk. Then again, the deft hints as to their
      friendship with Arthur Berkeley, as to Ernest&rsquo;s stay at Dunbude, and
      as to her own fear lest Edie should be too learned for her, all tended to
      bring out whatever points of interest they had together: while the casual
      touch about poor Harry&rsquo;s reputation, and the final mention of little
      Dot by name, completed the conquest of Edie&rsquo;s simple, gentle little
      woman&rsquo;s heart. So this was the great Lady Hilda Tregellis, she
      thought, of whom she had heard so much, and whom she had dreaded so
      greatly as a grand rival! Why, after all, she was exactly like any other
      Devonshire girl in Calcombe Pomeroy, except, perhaps, that she was easier
      to get on with, and smiled a great deal more pleasantly than ten out of a
      dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s very kind indeed of you to come,&rsquo; Edie answered, smiling
      back as well as she was able the first moment that Lady Hilda allowed her
      a chance to edge in a word sideways. &lsquo;Ernest will be so very very
      sorry that he&rsquo;s missed you when he comes in. He&rsquo;s spoken to me
      a great deal about you ever so many times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, has he really?&rsquo; Lady Hilda asked quickly, with unmistakable
      interest and pleasure. &lsquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;m so glad of that, for to
      tell you the truth, Mrs. Le Breton, though he was really always very kind
      to me, and so patient with all my stupidity, I more than half fancied he
      didn&rsquo;t exactly like me. In fact, I was dreadfully afraid he thought
      me a perfect nuisance. I&rsquo;m so sorry he isn&rsquo;t in, because the
      truth is, I came partly to see him as well as to see you, and I should be
      awfully disappointed if I had to miss him. Where&rsquo;s he gone, if I may
      ask? Perhaps I may be able to wait and see him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, he&rsquo;s only out walking somewhere&mdash;ur&mdash;somewhere about
      Holloway,&rsquo; Edie answered, half blushing at the nature of their
      neighbourhood, and glancing round the little room to see how it was likely
      to strike so grand a person as Lady Hilda Tregellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda noticed the glance, and made as if she did not notice it. Her heart
      had begun to warm at once to this poor, pale, eager-looking little woman,
      who had had the doubtful happiness of winning Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s
      love. &lsquo;Then I shall certainly wait and see him, Mrs. Le Breton.&rsquo;
      she said cordially. &lsquo;What a dear cosy little room you&rsquo;ve got
      here, to be sure. I do so love those nice bright little cottage parlours,
      with their pretty pots of flowers and cheerful furniture&mdash;so much
      warmer and more comfortable, you know, than the great dreary empty barns
      that most people go and do penance by living in. If ever I marry&mdash;which
      I don&rsquo;t suppose I ever shall do, for nobody&rsquo;ll have me, I&rsquo;m
      sorry to say: at least, nobody but stupid people in the peerage, Algies
      and Berties and Monties I always call them&mdash;well, if I ever do marry,
      I shall have a cosy little house just like this one, with no unnecessary
      space to walk over every time you come in or out, and with a chance of
      keeping yourself warm without having to crone over the fire in order to
      get safely out of the horrid draughts. And Dot, now let me see, how old is
      she by this time? I ought to remember, I&rsquo;m sure, for Mr. Berkeley
      told me all about her at the time; and I said should I write and ask if I
      might stand as godmother; and Mr. Berkeley laughed at me, and said what
      could I be dreaming of, and did I think you were going to make your baby
      liable to fine and imprisonment if it ever published works hereafter on
      philosophy or something of the sort. So delightfully original of all of
      you, really.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once started on that fertile theme of female conversation, Edie and Hilda
      got on well enough in all conscience to satisfy the most exacting mind.
      Dot was duly brought in and exhibited by Mrs. Halliss; and was pronounced
      to be the very sweetest, dearest, darlingest little duck ever seen on
      earth since the beginning of all things. Her various points of likeness to
      all her relations were duly discussed; and Hilda took particular pains to
      observe that she didn&rsquo;t in the very faintest degree resemble that
      old horror, Lady Le Breton. Then her whole past history was fully related,
      she had been fed on, and what illnesses she had had, and how many teeth
      she had got, and all the other delightful nothings so perennially
      interesting to the maternal heart. Hilda listened to the whole account
      with unfeigned attention, and begged leave to be allowed to dance Dot in
      her own strong arms, and tickled her fat cheek with her slender
      forefinger, and laughed with genuine delight when the baby smiled again at
      her and turned her face to be tickled a second time. Gradually Hilda
      brought the conversation round to Ernest&rsquo;s journalistic experiences,
      and at last she said very quietly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to learn from
      Mr. Berkeley, dear, that your husband doesn&rsquo;t get quite as much work
      to do as he would like to have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie&rsquo;s tender eyes filled at once with swimming tears. That one word
      &lsquo;dear,&rsquo; said so naturally and simply, touched her heart at
      once with its genuine half unspoken sympathy. &lsquo;Oh, Lady Hilda,&rsquo;
      she answered falteringly, &lsquo;please don&rsquo;t make me talk about
      that. We are so very, very, very poor. I can&rsquo;t bear to talk about it
      to you. Please, please don&rsquo;t make me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda looked at her with the moisture welling up in her own eyes too, and
      said softly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m SO sorry: dear, dear little Mrs. Le Breton,
      I&rsquo;m so very, very, very sorry for you! from the bottom of my heart I&rsquo;m
      sorry for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It isn&rsquo;t for myself, you know,&rsquo; Edie answered quickly:
      &lsquo;for myself, of course, I could stand anything; but it&rsquo;s the
      trouble and privations for darling Ernest. Oh, Lady Hilda, I can&rsquo;t
      bear to say it, but he&rsquo;s dying, he&rsquo;s dying.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda took the pretty small hand affectionately in hers. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,
      dear, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said, brushing away a tear from her own eyes
      at the same time. &lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t, believe me, he isn&rsquo;t. And
      don&rsquo;t call me by that horrid stiff name, dear, please don&rsquo;t.
      Call me Hilda. I should be so pleased and flattered if you would call me
      Hilda. And may I call you Edie? I know your husband calls you Edie,
      because Mr. Ronald Le Breton told me so. I want to be a friend of yours;
      and I feel sure, if only you will let me, that we might be very good and
      helpful friends indeed together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edie pressed her hand softly. How very different from the imaginary Lady
      Hilda she had pictured to herself in her timid, girlish fancy! How much
      even dear Ernest had been mistaken as to what there was of womanly really
      in her. &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak so kindly to me,&rsquo; she said
      imploringly; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t speak so kindly, or else you&rsquo;ll make
      me cry. I can&rsquo;t bear to hear you speak so kindly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Cry, dear,&rsquo; Lady Hilda whispered in a gentle tone, kissing her
      forehead delicately as she spoke: &lsquo;cry and relieve yourself. There&rsquo;s
      nothing gives one so much comfort when one&rsquo;s heart is bursting as a
      regular good downright cry.&rsquo; And, suiting the action to the word,
      forthwith Lady Hilda laid her own statuesque head down beside Edie&rsquo;s,
      and so those two weeping women, rivals once in a vague way, and now bound
      to one another by a new-found tie, mingled their tears silently together
      for ten minutes in unuttered sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sat there, both tearful and speechless, with Lady Hilda soothing
      Edie&rsquo;s wan hand tenderly in hers, and leaning above her, and
      stroking her hair softly with a sister&rsquo;s fondness, the door opened
      very quietly, and Arthur Berkeley stood for a moment pausing in the
      passage, and looking in without a word upon the unexpected sight that
      greeted his wondering vision. He had come to call upon Ernest about some
      possible opening for a new writer on a paper lately started; and hearing
      the sound of sobs within had opened the door quietly and tentatively. He
      could hardly believe his own eyes when he actually saw Lady Hilda
      Tregellis sitting there side by side with Edie Le Breton, kissing her pale
      forehead a dozen times in a minute, and crying over her like a child with
      unwonted tears of unmistakable sympathy. For ten seconds Arthur held the
      door ajar in his hands, and gazed silently with the awe of chivalrous
      respect upon the tearful, beautiful picture. Then he shut the door again
      noiselessly and unperceived, and stole softly out into the street to wait
      alone for Ernest&rsquo;s return. It was not for him to intrude his
      unbidden presence upon the sacred sorrow of those two weeping
      sister-women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted a cigar outside, and walked up and down a neighbouring street
      feverishly till he thought it likely the call would be finished. &lsquo;Dear
      little Mrs. Le Breton,&rsquo; he said to himself softly, ‘dear little Miss
      Butterfly of the days that are dead; softened and sweetened still more by
      suffering, with the beauty of holiness glowing in your face, how I wish
      some good for you could unexpectedly come out of this curious visit.
      Though I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s possible: I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s
      possible. The stream carries us all down unresistingly before its
      senseless flood, and sweeps us at last, sooner or later, like helpless
      logs, into the unknown sea. Poor Ernest is drifting fast thitherwards
      before the current, and nothing on earth, it seems to me, can conceivably
      stop him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paced up and down a little, with a quick, unsteady tread, and took a
      puff or two again at his cigar abstractedly. Then he held it thoughtfully
      between his fingers for a while and began to hum a few bars from his own
      new opera then in course of composition&mdash;a stately long-drawn air, it
      was something like the rustle of Hilda Tregellis&rsquo;s satin train as
      she swept queenlike down the broad marble staircase of some great
      Elizabethan country palace. &lsquo;And dear Lady Hilda too,&rsquo; he went
      on, musingly: &lsquo;dear, kind, sympathising Lady Hilda. Who on earth
      would ever have thought she had it in her to comfort that poor, weeping,
      sorrowing girl as I just now saw her doing? Dear Lady Hilda! Kind Lady
      Hilda! I have undervalued you and overlooked you, because of the mere
      accident of your titled birth, but I could have kissed you myself, for
      pure gratitude, that very minute, Hilda Tregellis, when I saw you stooping
      down and kissing that dear white forehead that looked so pale and womanly
      and beautiful. Yes, Hilda, I could have kissed you. I could have kissed
      your own grand, smooth, white marble forehead. And no very great trial of
      endurance, either, Arthur Berkeley, if it comes to that; for say what you
      will of her, she&rsquo;s a beautiful, stately, queenlike woman indeed; and
      it somehow strikes me she&rsquo;s a truer and better woman, too, than you
      have ever yet in your shallow superficiality imagined. Not like little
      Miss Butterfly! Oh, no, not like little Miss Butterfly! But still, there
      are keys and keys in music; and if every tune was pitched to the self-same
      key, even the tenderest, what a monotonous, dreary world it would be to
      live and sing in after all. Perhaps a man might make himself a little
      shrine not wholly without sweet savour of pure incense for beautiful,
      stately, queenlike Hilda Tregellis too! But no; I mustn&rsquo;t think of
      it. I have no other duty or prospect in life possible as yet while dear
      little Miss Butterfly still remains practically unprovided for!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; HOPE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      From Edie Le Breton&rsquo;s lodgings, Hilda Tregellis drove straight,
      without stopping all the way, to Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s house at Chelsea;
      for Arthur had long since risen to the dignity of an enfranchised
      householder, and had bought himself a pretty cottage near the Embankment,
      with room enough for himself and the Progenitor, and even for any possible
      future domestic contingency in the way of wife and children. It was a very
      unconventional thing for her to do, no doubt; but Lady Hilda was certainly
      not the person to be deterred from doing anything she contemplated on the
      bare ground of its extreme unconventionally; and so far was she from
      objecting personally to her visit on this score, that before she rang the
      Berkeleys&rsquo; bell she looked quietly at her little bijou watch, and
      said with a bland smile to the suspicious Mr. Jenkins, &lsquo;Let me see,
      Jenkins; it&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock. I shall lunch with my friends here
      this morning; so you may take the carriage home now for my lady, and I
      shall cab it back, or come round by Metropolitan.&rsquo; Jenkins was too
      much accustomed to Lady Hilda&rsquo;s unaccountable vagaries to express
      any surprise at her wildest resolutions, even if she had proposed to go
      home on a costermonger&rsquo;s barrow; so he only touched his hat
      respectfully, in his marionette fashion, and drove away at once without
      further colloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is Mr. Berkeley at home?&rsquo; Hilda asked of the pretty servant girl
      who opened the door to her, mentally taking note at the same time that
      Arthur&rsquo;s aesthetic tendencies evidently extended even to his human
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Which Mr. Berkeley?&rsquo; the girl asked in reply. &lsquo;Mr. Berkeley
      senerer, &lsquo;e&rsquo;s at &lsquo;ome, but Mr. Arthur, &lsquo;e&rsquo;s
      gone up this mornin&rsquo; to &lsquo;Olloway.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda seized with avidity upon this unexpected and almost providential
      opening. &lsquo;No, is he?&rsquo; she said, delighted. &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll
      go in and see Mr. Berkeley senior. No card, thank you: no name: tell him
      merely a lady would like to see him. I dare say Mr. Arthur&rsquo;ll be
      back before long from Holloway.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl hesitated a moment as if in doubt, and surveyed Lady Hilda from
      head to foot. Hilda, whose eyes were still red from crying, couldn&rsquo;t
      help laughing outright at the obvious cause of the girl&rsquo;s
      hesitation. &lsquo;Do as I tell you,&rsquo; she said in her imperious way.
      &lsquo;Who on earth do you take me for, my good girl? That&rsquo;s my
      card, see: but you needn&rsquo;t give it to Mr. Berkeley senior. Now go
      and tell him at once that a lady is waiting to see him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The innate respect of the English working classes for the kind of nobility
      that is supposed to be represented by the British peerage made the girl
      drop an instinctive curtsey as she looked at the card, and answer in a
      voice of hushed surprise, &lsquo;Yes, my lady.&rsquo; She had heard Lady
      Hilda Tregellis spoken of more than once at her master&rsquo;s table, and
      she knew, of course, that so great a personage as that could do no wrong.
      So she merely ushered her visitor at once into Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s
      beautiful little study, with its delicate grey pomegranate wall paper and
      its exquisite unpolished oak fittings, and said simply, in an overawed
      manner, &lsquo;A lady wishes to speak to you, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old shoemaker looked up from the English translation of Ribot&rsquo;s
      ‘Psychologie Anglaise Contemporaine,&rsquo; with whose intricacies he was
      manfully struggling, and rose with native politeness to welcome Hilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good morning,&rsquo; Hilda said, extending her hand to him with one of
      her beaming disarming smiles, and annihilating all that was most
      obtrusively democratic in him at once by her pleasant manner. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      a friend of your son&rsquo;s, Mr. Berkeley, and I&rsquo;ve come here to
      see him about very particular private business&mdash;in short, on an
      errand of charity. Will he be long gone, do you know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not very,&rsquo; the Progenitor answered, in a somewhat embarrassed
      manner, surveying her curiously. &lsquo;At least, I should think not. He&rsquo;s
      gone to Holloway for an hour or two, but I fancy he&rsquo;ll be back for
      two o&rsquo;clock luncheon, Miss&mdash;&mdash;ur, I don&rsquo;t think I
      caught your name, did I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To Holloway,&rsquo; Hilda echoed, taking no notice of his suggested
      query. &lsquo;Oh, then he&rsquo;s gone to see the poor dear Le Bretons, of
      course. Why, that&rsquo;s just what I wanted to see him about. If you&rsquo;ll
      allow me then, I&rsquo;ll just stop and have lunch with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The dickens you will,&rsquo; the Progenitor thought to himself in
      speechless astonishment. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s really awfully cool of you.
      However, I dare say it&rsquo;s usual to invite oneself in the state of
      life that that boy Artie has gone and hoisted himself into, most
      unnaturally. A fine lady, no doubt, of their modern pattern; but in my
      day, up in Paddington, we should have called her a brazen hussey.&mdash;Certainly,
      if you will,&rsquo; he added aloud. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ve come on any
      errand that will do any good to the Le Bretons, I&rsquo;m sure my son&rsquo;ll
      be delighted to see you. He&rsquo;s greatly grieved at their unhappy
      condition.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve nothing much to suggest of any very practical
      sort,&rsquo; Hilda answered, with a slight sigh; &lsquo;but at least I
      should like to talk with him about the matter. Something must be done for
      these two poor young people, you know, Mr. Berkeley. Something must really
      be done to help them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you&rsquo;re interested in them, Miss&mdash;ur&mdash;ur&mdash;ah,
      yes&mdash;are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Look at my eyes,&rsquo; Hilda said plumply. &lsquo;Are they very red, Mr.
      Berkeley?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well....ur...yes, if I may venture to say so to a lady,&rsquo; the old
      shoemaker answered hesitatingly, with unwonted gallantry. &lsquo;I should
      say they were a trifle, ur, just a trifle roseate, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite so,&rsquo; Hilda went on, seriously. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it. They&rsquo;re
      red with crying. I&rsquo;ve been crying like a baby all the morning with
      that poor, dear, sweet little angel of a Mrs. Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you&rsquo;re a great friend of hers, I suppose,&rsquo; the
      Progenitor suggested mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never set eyes on her in my life before this morning, on the contrary,&rsquo;
      Hilda continued in her garrulous fashion. &lsquo;But, oh, Mr. Berkeley, if
      you&rsquo;d only seen that dear little woman, crying as if her heart would
      break, and telling me that dear Ernest was dying, actually dying; why&mdash;there&mdash;excuse
      me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help it, you know; we women are always crying about
      something or other, aren&rsquo;t we?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man laid his hand on hers quietly. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind ME, my
      dear,&rsquo; he said with genuine tenderness. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me a
      bit; I&rsquo;m only an old shoemaker, as I dare say you&rsquo;ve heard
      before now; but I know you&rsquo;ll be the better for crying&mdash;women
      always are&mdash;and tears shed on somebody else&rsquo;s account are never
      thrown away, my dear, are they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda took his hand between hers, and wiping her eyes once more whispered
      softly, &lsquo;No, Mr. Berkeley, no; perhaps they&rsquo;re not; but oh,
      they&rsquo;re so useless; so very, very, very useless. Do you know, I
      never felt my own powerlessness and helplessness in all my life so much as
      I did at that dear, patient little Mrs. Le Breton&rsquo;s this very
      morning. There I sat, knowing she was in dire need of money for her poor
      husband, and wanting sufficient food and drink, perhaps, for herself, and
      him, and the dear darling baby; and in my hand in my muff I had my purse
      there with five tenners&mdash;Bank of England ten-pound notes, you know&mdash;fifty
      pounds altogether, rolled up inside it; and I would have given anything if
      only I could have pulled them out and made them a present to her then and
      there; and I couldn&rsquo;t, you see: and, oh, Mr. Berkeley, isn&rsquo;t
      it terrible to look at them? And then, before I left, poor Mr. Le Breton
      himself came in, and I was quite shocked to see him. I used to know him a
      few years ago, and even then he wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call robust
      by any means; but now, oh, dear me, he does look so awfully ill and
      haggard and miserable that it quite made me break down again, and I cried
      about him before his very face; and the moment I got away, I said to the
      coachman, &ldquo;Jenkins, drive straight off to the Embankment at Chelsea;&rdquo;
      and here I am, you see, waiting to talk with your clever son about it;
      for, really, Mr. Berkeley, the poor Le Bretons haven&rsquo;t got a single
      friend anywhere like your son Arthur.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Lady Hilda went on to praise Arthur&rsquo;s music to the
      Progenitor, and to speak of how much admired he was everywhere, and to
      hint that so much genius and musical power must of course be largely
      hereditary. Whereat the old man, not unmoved by her gentle insinuating
      flattery, at last confessed to his own lifelong musical tastes, and even
      casually acknowledged that the motive for one or two of the minor songs in
      the famous operas was not entirely of Arthur&rsquo;s own unaided
      invention. And so, from one subject to another, they passed on so quickly,
      and hit it off with one another so exactly (for Hilda had a wonderful
      knack of leading up to everybody&rsquo;s strong points), that long before
      lunch was ready, the Progenitor had been quite won over by the
      fascinations of the brazen hussey, and was prepared to admit that she was
      really a very nice, kind, tender-hearted, intelligent, appreciative, and
      discriminating young lady. True, she had not read Mill or Fawcett, and was
      ignorant of the very name of Herbert Spencer; but she had a vast
      admiration for his dear boy Artie, and she saw that he himself knew a
      thing or two in his own modest way, though he was only what the grand
      world she moved in would doubtless call an old superannuated journeyman
      shoemaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, yes, a shoemaker! so I&rsquo;ve heard somewhere, I fancy,&rsquo; Lady
      Hilda remarked brightly, when for the third time in the course of their
      conversation he informed her with great dignity of the interesting fact;
      &lsquo;how very delightful and charming that is, really, now isn&rsquo;t
      it? So original, you know, to make shoes instead of going into some
      useless profession, especially when you&rsquo;re such a great reader and
      student and thinker as you are&mdash;for I see you&rsquo;re a philosopher
      and a psychologist already, Mr. Berkeley&rsquo;&mdash;Hilda considered it
      rather a bold effort on her part to pronounce the word &lsquo;psychologist&rsquo;
      at the very first trial without stumbling; but though she was a little
      doubtful about the exact pronunciation of that fearful vocable, she felt
      quite at her ease about the fact at least, because she carefully noticed
      him lay down Ribot on the table beside him, name upward; &lsquo;one can&rsquo;t
      help finding that much out on a very short acquaintance, can one? Though,
      indeed, now I come to think of it, I believe I&rsquo;ve heard often that
      men of your calling generally ARE very fond of reading, and are very
      philosophical, and clever, and political, and all that sort of thing; and
      they say that&rsquo;s the reason, of course, why Northampton&rsquo;s such
      an exceptionally intelligent constituency, and always returns such
      thoroughgoing able logical Radicals.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s eyes beamed, as she spoke, with inexpressible pride
      and pleasure. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very glad indeed to hear you say so,&rsquo;
      he answered promptly with a complacent self-satisfied smile, &lsquo;and I
      believe you&rsquo;re right too, Miss, ur&mdash;ur&mdash;ur&mdash;quite so.
      The practice of shoemaking undoubtedly tends to develop a very high and
      exceptional level of general intelligence and logical power.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rsquo; Hilda answered demurely, in a tone of the
      deepest and sincerest conviction; &lsquo;and when I heard somebody say
      somewhere, that your son was...&mdash;well, WAS your son, I said to myself
      at once, &ldquo;Ah, well, there now, that quite accounts, of course, for
      young Mr. Berkeley&rsquo;s very extraordinary and unusual abilities!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She&rsquo;s really a most sensible, well-informed young woman, whoever
      she is,&rsquo; the Progenitor thought to himself silently; &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s
      certainly a pity that dear Artie couldn&rsquo;t take a fancy to some nice,
      appreciative, kind-hearted, practical girl like that now, instead of
      wearing away all the best days of his life in useless regret for that poor
      slender, unsubstantial nonentity of a watery little Mrs. Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By two o&rsquo;clock lunch was ready, and just as it had been announced,
      Arthur Berkeley ran up the front steps, and let himself in with his
      proprietory latch-key. Turning straight into the dining-room, he was just
      in time to see his own father walking into lunch arm in arm with Lady
      Hilda Tregellis. As Mrs. Hallis had graphically expressed it, he felt as
      if you might have knocked him down with a feather! Was she absolutely
      ubiquitous, then, this pervasive Lady Hilda? and was he destined wherever
      he went to come upon her suddenly in the most unexpected and
      incomprehensible situations?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you sit down here, my dear,&rsquo; the Progenitor was saying to
      Hilda at the exact moment he entered, &lsquo;or would you prefer your back
      to the fire?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Berkeley opened his eyes wide with unspeakable amazement. ‘What,
      YOU here,&rsquo; he exclaimed, coming forward suddenly to shake hands with
      Hilda; &lsquo;why, I saw you only a couple of hours since at the Le
      Bretons&rsquo; at Holloway.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You did!&rsquo; Hilda cried with almost equal astonishment, &lsquo;Why,
      how was that? I never saw YOU.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur sighed quietly. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered, with a curious look
      at the Progenitor; &lsquo;you were engaged when I opened the door, and I
      didn&rsquo;t like to disturb you. You were&mdash;you were speaking with
      poor little Mrs. Le Breton. But I&rsquo;m so much obliged to you for your
      kindness to them, Lady Hilda; so very much obliged to you for your great
      kindness to them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Progenitor&rsquo;s turn now to start in surprise. &lsquo;What!
      Lady Hilda!&rsquo; he cried with a bewildered look. &lsquo;Lady Hilda! Did
      I hear you say &ldquo;Lady Hilda&rdquo;? Is this Lady Hilda Tregellis,
      then, that I&rsquo;ve heard you talk about so often, Artie?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, of course, Father. You didn&rsquo;t know who it was, then, didn&rsquo;t
      you? Lady Hilda, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve been stealing a march upon
      the poor unsuspecting hostile Progenitor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not quite that, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; Hilda replied, laughing; &lsquo;only
      after the very truculent character I had heard of your father as a regular
      red-hot militant Radical, I thought I&rsquo;d better not send in my name
      to him at once for fear it might prejudice him against me before first
      acquaintance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Progenitor looked at her steadfastly from head to foot, standing
      before him there in her queenly beauty, as if she were some strange wild
      beast that he had been requested to inspect and report upon for a
      scientific purpose. &lsquo;Lady Hilda Tregellis!&rsquo; he said slowly and
      deliberately; &lsquo;Lady Hilda Tregellis! So this is Lady Hilda
      Tregellis, is it? Well, all I can say is this, then, that as far as I can
      judge her, Lady Hilda Tregellis is a very sensible, modest, intelligent,
      well-conducted young woman, which is more than I could possibly have
      expected from a person of her unfortunate and distressing hereditary
      antecedents. But you know, my dear, it was a very mean trick of you to go
      and take an old man&rsquo;s heart by guile and stratagem in that way!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda laughed a little uneasily. The Progenitor&rsquo;s manner was perhaps
      a trifle too open and unconventional even for her. &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
      for that I came, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; she said again with one of her sunny
      smiles, which brought the Progenitor metaphorically to her feet again,
      &lsquo;but to talk over this matter of the poor Le Bretons with your son.
      Oh, Mr. Arthur, something must really be done to help them. I know you say
      there&rsquo;s nothing to be done; but there must be; we must find it out;
      we must invent it; we must compel it. When I sat there this morning with
      that dear little woman and saw her breaking her full heart over her
      husband&rsquo;s trouble, I said to myself, somehow, Hilda Tregellis, if
      you can&rsquo;t find a way out of this, you&rsquo;re not worth your salt
      in this world, and you&rsquo;d better make haste and take a rapid
      through-ticket at once to the next, if there is one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Which is more than doubtful, really,&rsquo; the Progenitor muttered
      softly half under his breath; &lsquo;which, as Strauss has conclusively
      shown, is certainly a good deal more than doubtful.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur took no notice of the interruption, but merely answered
      imploringly, with a despairing gesture of his hands, &lsquo;What are we to
      do, Lady Hilda? What can we possibly do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, sit down and have some lunch first,&rsquo; Hilda rejoined with
      practical common-sense, &lsquo;and then talk it over rationally
      afterwards, instead of wringing our hands helplessly like a pair of
      Frenchmen in a street difficulty.&rsquo; (Hilda had a fine old crusted
      English contempt, by the way, for those vastly inferior and foolish
      creatures known as foreigners.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Berkeley sat down promptly, and they proceeded to take
      counsel together in this hard matter over the cutlets and claret provided
      before them. &lsquo;Ernest and Mrs. Le Breton told me all about your
      visit,&rsquo; Arthur went on, soon after; &lsquo;and they&rsquo;re so much
      obliged to you for having taken the trouble to look them up in their sore
      distress. Do you know, Lady Hilda, I think you&rsquo;ve quite made a
      conquest of our dear little friend, Mrs. Le Breton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; Hilda responded with a smile,
      &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m sure, at any rate, that the sweet little woman quite
      made a conquest of me, Mr. Berkeley. In fact, I can&rsquo;t say what you
      think, but for my part I&rsquo;m determined an effort must be made one way
      or another to save them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s no use,&rsquo; Arthur answered, shaking his head sadly;
      &lsquo;it can&rsquo;t be done. There&rsquo;s nothing for it but to let
      them float down helplessly with the tide, wherever it may bear them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stuff and nonsense,&rsquo; Hilda replied energetically. &lsquo;All
      rubbish, utter rubbish, and if I were a man as you are, Mr. Berkeley, I
      should be ashamed to take such a desponding view of the situation. If we
      say it&rsquo;s got to be done, it will be done, and that&rsquo;s an end of
      it. Work must and can be found for him somehow or somewhere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But the man&rsquo;s dying,&rsquo; Arthur interrupted with a vehement
      gesture. ‘There&rsquo;s no more work left in him. The only thing that&rsquo;s
      any use is to send him off to Madeira, or Egypt, or Catania, or somewhere
      of that sort, and let him die quietly among the palms and cactuses and
      aloes. That&rsquo;s Sir Antony Wraxall&rsquo;s opinion, and surely nobody
      in London can know half as well as he does about the matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sir Antony&rsquo;s a fool,&rsquo; Hilda responded with refreshing
      bluntness. ‘He knows nothing on earth at all about it. He&rsquo;s
      accustomed to prescribing for a lot of us idle good-for-nothing rich
      people&rsquo;&mdash;(&lsquo;Very true,&rsquo; the Progenitor assented
      parenthetically;) &lsquo;and he&rsquo;s got into a fixed habit of
      prescribing a Nile voyage, just as he&rsquo;s got into a fixed habit of
      prescribing old wine, and carriage exercise, and ten thousand a year to
      all his patients. What Mr. Le Breton really wants is not Egypt, or old
      wine, or Sir Antony, or anything of the sort, but relief from this
      pressing load of anxiety and responsibility. Put him in my hands for six
      months, and I&rsquo;ll back myself at a hundred to six against Sir Antony
      to cure him for a monkey.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For a what!&rsquo; the Progenitor asked with a puzzled expression of
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Back myself for a monkey, you know,&rsquo; Hilda answered, without
      perceiving the cause of the old man&rsquo;s innocent confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Progenitor was evidently none the wiser still for Hilda&rsquo;s
      answer, though he forbore to pursue the subject any farther, lest he
      should betray his obvious ignorance of aristocratic manners and dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur looked up at Lady Hilda with something like the gleam of a
      new-born hope on his distressed features. &lsquo;Lady Hilda,&rsquo; he
      said almost cheerfully, &lsquo;you really speak as if you had some
      practicable plan actually in prospect. It seems to me, if anybody can pull
      them through, you can, because you&rsquo;ve got such a grand reserve of
      faith and energy. What is it, now, you think of doing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,&rsquo; Hilda answered, taken a little aback at this practical
      question, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve hardly got my plan matured yet; but I&rsquo;ve
      got a plan; and I thought it all out as far as it went as I came along
      here just now in the carriage. The great thing is, we must inspire Mr. Le
      Breton with a new confidence; we must begin by showing him we believe in
      him, and letting him see that he may still manage in some way or other to
      retrieve himself. He has lost all hope: we must begin with him over again.
      I&rsquo;ve got an idea, but it&rsquo;ll take money. Now, I can give up
      half my allowance for the next year&mdash;the Le Bretons need never know
      anything about it&mdash;that&rsquo;ll be something: you&rsquo;re a rich
      man now, I believe, Mr. Berkeley; will you make up as much as I do, if my
      plan seems a feasible one to you for retrieving the position?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Progenitor answered quickly for him: &lsquo;Miss Tregellis,&rsquo; he
      said, with a little tremor in his voice, &lsquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;ll excuse
      me, my dear, but it&rsquo;s against my principles to call anybody my lady:&mdash;he
      will, I know he will; and if he wouldn&rsquo;t, why, my dear, I&rsquo;d go
      back to my cobbling and earn it myself rather than that you or your
      friends should go without it for a single minute.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur said nothing, but he bowed his head silently. What a lot of good
      there was really in that splendid woman, and what a commanding, energetic,
      masterful way she had about her! To a feckless, undecided, faltering man
      like Arthur Berkeley there was something wonderfully attractive and
      magnificent, after all, in such an imperious resolute woman as Lady Hilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then this is my plan,&rsquo; Hilda went on hastily. &lsquo;We must do
      something that&rsquo;ll take Mr. Le Breton out of himself for a short time
      entirely&mdash;that&rsquo;ll give him occupation of a kind he thinks
      right, and at the same time put money in his pocket. Now, he&rsquo;s
      always talking about this socialistic business of his; but why doesn&rsquo;t
      he tell us what he has actually seen about the life and habits of the
      really poor? Mrs. Le Breton tells me he knows the East End well: why doesn&rsquo;t
      he sit down and give us a good rattling, rousing, frightening description
      of all that&rsquo;s in it? Of course, I don&rsquo;t care twopence about
      the poor myself&mdash;not in the lump, I mean&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr.
      Berkeley,&rsquo;&mdash;for the Progenitor gave a start of surprise and
      astonishment&mdash;&lsquo;you know we women are nothing if not concrete;
      we never care for anything in the abstract, Mr. Le Breton used to tell me;
      we want the particular case brought home to our sympathies before we can
      interest ourselves about it. After all, even YOU who are men don&rsquo;t
      feel very much for all the miserable wretched people there are in China,
      you know; they&rsquo;re too far away for even you to bother your heads
      about. But I DO care about the Le Bretons, and it strikes me we might help
      them a little in this way. I know a lot of artists, Mr. Berkeley; and I
      know one who I think would just do for the very work I want to set him.
      (He&rsquo;s poor, too, by the way, and I don&rsquo;t mind giving him a
      lift at the same time and killing two birds with one stone.) Very well,
      then; I go to him, and say, &ldquo;Mr. Verney,&rdquo; I say,&mdash;there
      now, I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you his name, but no matter; &ldquo;Mr.
      Verney,&rdquo; I shall say, &ldquo;a friend of mine in the writing line is
      going to pay some visits to the very poor quarters in the East End, and
      write about it, which will make a great noise in the world as sure as
      midday.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But how do you know it will?&rsquo; asked the Progenitor, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda turned round upon him with an unfeigned look of startled
      astonishment. &lsquo;How do I know it will?&rsquo; she said confidently.
      &lsquo;Why, because I mean it to, Mr. Berkeley. Because I say it shall.
      Because I choose to make it. Two Cabinet ministers shall quote it in the
      House, and a duke shall write letters to the &ldquo;Times&rdquo;
      denouncing it as an intensely wicked and revolutionary publication. If I
      choose to float it, I WILL float it.&mdash;Well, &ldquo;Mr. Verney,&rdquo;
      I say for example, &ldquo;will you undertake to accompany him and make
      sketches? It&rsquo;ll be unpleasant work, I know, because I&rsquo;ve been
      there myself to see, and the places don&rsquo;t smell nice at all&mdash;worse
      than Genoa or the old town at Nice even, I can tell you: but it&rsquo;ll
      make you a name; and in any case the publisher who&rsquo;s getting it up&rsquo;ll
      pay you well for it.&rdquo; Of course, Mr. Verney says &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      Then we go on to Mr. Le Breton and say, &ldquo;A young artist of my
      acquaintance is making a pilgrimage into the East End to see for himself
      how the people live, and to make pictures of them to stir up the sluggish
      consciences of the lazy aristocrats&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s me and my
      people, of course: that&rsquo;ll be the way to work it. Play upon Mr. Le
      Breton&rsquo;s tenderest feelings. Make him feel he&rsquo;s fighting for
      the Cause; and he&rsquo;ll be ready to throw himself, heart and soul, into
      the spirit of the project. I don&rsquo;t care twopence about the Cause
      myself, of course, so that&rsquo;s flat, and I don&rsquo;t pretend to,
      either, Mr. Berkeley; but I care a great deal for the misery of that poor,
      dear, pale little woman, sitting there with me this morning and regularly
      sobbing her heart out; and if I can do anything to help her, why, I shall
      be only too delighted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Le Breton&rsquo;s a well-meaning young fellow, certainly,&rsquo; the
      Progenitor murmured gently in a voice of graceful concession; &lsquo;and I
      believe his heart&rsquo;s really in the Cause, as you call it; but you
      know, my dear, he&rsquo;s very far from being sound in his economical
      views as to the relations of capital and labour. Far from sound, as John
      Stuart Mill would have judged the question, I can solemnly assure you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very well,&rsquo; Hilda went on, almost without noticing the
      interruption. ‘We shall say to him, or rather we shall get our publisher
      to say to him, that as he&rsquo;s interested in the matter, and knows the
      East End well, he has been selected&mdash;shall we put it on somebody&rsquo;s
      recommendation?&mdash;to accompany the artist, and to supply the reading
      matter, the letter-press I think you call it; in fact, to write up to our
      illustrator&rsquo;s pictures; and that he is to be decently paid for his
      trouble. He must do something graphic, something stirring, something to
      wake up lazy people in the West End to a passing sense of what he calls
      their responsibilities. That&rsquo;ll seem like real work to Mr. Le
      Breton. It&rsquo;ll put new heart into him; he&rsquo;ll take up the matter
      vigorously; he&rsquo;ll do it well; he&rsquo;ll write a splendid book; and
      I shall guarantee its making a stir in the world this very dull season.
      What&rsquo;s the use of knowing half the odiously commonplace bores and
      prigs in all London if you can&rsquo;t float a single little heterodox
      pamphlet for a particular purpose? What do you think of it, Mr. Berkeley?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur sighed again. &lsquo;It seems to me, Lady Hilda,&rsquo; he said,
      regretfully, ‘a very slender straw indeed to hang Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s
      life on: but any straw is better than nothing to a drowning man. And you
      have so much faith yourself, and mean to fling yourself into it so
      earnestly, that I shouldn&rsquo;t be wholly surprised if you were somehow
      to pull it through. If you do, Lady Hilda&mdash;if you manage to save
      these two poor young people from the verge of starvation&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      have done a very great good work in your day, and you&rsquo;ll have made
      me personally eternally your debtor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it mere fancy, the Progenitor wondered, or did Hilda cast her eyes
      down a little and half blush as she answered in a lower and more tremulous
      tone than usual, &lsquo;I hope I shall, Mr. Berkeley; for their sakes, I
      hope I shall.&rsquo; The Progenitor didn&rsquo;t feel quite certain about
      it, but somehow, more than once that evening, as he sat reading Spencer&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Data of Ethics&rsquo; in his easy-chair, a curious vision of Lady
      Hilda as a future daughter-in-law floated vaguely with singular
      persistence before the old shoemaker&rsquo;s bewildered eyes. &lsquo;It&rsquo;d
      be a shocking falling away on Artie&rsquo;s part from his father&rsquo;s
      principles,&rsquo; he muttered inarticulately to himself several times
      over; &lsquo;and yet, on the other hand, I can&rsquo;t deny that this bit
      of a Tregellis girl is really a very tidy, good-looking, respectable,
      well-meaning, intelligent, and appreciative sort of a young woman, who&rsquo;d,
      maybe, make Artie as good a wife as anybody else he&rsquo;d be likely to
      pitch on.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; THE TIDE TURNS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Ernest Le Breton got a letter from the business house of a well-known
      publishing firm, asking him whether he would consent to supply appropriate
      letterpress for an illustrated work on the poor of London, then in course
      of preparation, his delight and relief were positively unbounded. That
      anyone should come and ask him for work, instead of his asking them, was
      in itself a singular matter for surprise and congratulation; that the
      request should be based on the avowed ground of his known political and
      social opinions was almost incredible. Ernest felt that it was a triumph,
      not only for him, but for his dearly-loved principles and beliefs as well.
      For the first time in his life, he was going to undertake a piece of work
      which he not only thought not wrong, but even considered hopeful and
      praise-worthy. Arthur Berkeley, who called round as if by accident the
      same morning, saw with delight that Lady Hilda&rsquo;s prognostication
      seemed likely to be fulfilled, and that if only Ernest could be given some
      congenial occupation there was still a chance, after all, for his
      permanent recovery; for it was clear enough that as there was hope, there
      must be a little life yet left in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lady Hilda who, as she herself expressively phrased it, had squared
      the publishers. She had called upon the head of the well-known house in
      person, and had told him fully and frankly exactly what was the nature of
      the interest she took in the poor of London. At first the publisher was
      scandalised and obdurate: the thing was not regular, he said&mdash;not in
      the ordinary way of business; his firm couldn&rsquo;t go writing letters
      of that sort to unknown young authors and artists. If she wanted the work
      done, she must let them give her own name as the promoter of the
      undertaking. But Hilda persevered, as she always did; she smiled, pleaded,
      cajoled, threatened, and made desperate love to the publisher to gain his
      acquiescence in her benevolent scheme. After all, even publishers are only
      human (though authors have been frequently known to deny the fact); and
      human nature, especially in England, is apt to be very little proof
      against the entreaties of a pretty girl who happens also to be an earl&rsquo;s
      daughter. So in the end, when Lady Hilda said most bewitchingly, &lsquo;I
      put it upon the grounds of a personal favour, Mr. Percival,&rsquo; the
      obdurate publisher gave way at last, and consented to do her bidding
      gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six weeks Ernest went daily with Ronald and the young artist into the
      familiar slums of Bethnal Green, and Bermondsey, and Lambeth, whose ins
      and outs he was beginning to know with painful accuracy; and every night
      he came back, and wrote down with a glowing pen all that he had seen and
      heard of distressing and terrible during his day&rsquo;s peregrination. It
      was an awful task from one point of view, for the scenes he had to visit
      and describe were often heart-rending; and Arthur feared more than once
      that the air of so many loathsome and noxious dens might still further
      accelerate the progress of Ernest&rsquo;s disease; but Lady Hilda said
      emphatically, No; and somehow Arthur was beginning now to conceive an
      immense respect for the practical value of Lady Hilda&rsquo;s vehement
      opinions. As a matter of fact, indeed, Ernest did not visibly suffer at
      all either from the unwonted hard work or from the strain upon mind and
      body to which he had been so little accustomed. Distressing as it all was,
      it was change, it was variety, it was occupation, it was relief from that
      terrible killing round of perpetual personal responsibility. Above all,
      Ernest really believed that here at last was an opportunity of doing some
      practical good in his generation, and he threw himself into it with all
      the passionate ardour of a naturally eager and vivid nature. The
      enthusiasm of humanity was upon him, and it kept him going at
      high-pressure rate, with no apparent loss of strength and vigour
      throughout the whole ordeal. To Arthur Berkeley&rsquo;s intense delight,
      he was even visibly fatter to the naked eye at the end of his six weeks&rsquo;
      exploration of the most dreary and desolate slums in all London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was written at white heat, as the best of such books always are,
      and it was engraved and printed at the very shortest possible notice.
      Terrible and ghastly it certainly was at last&mdash;instinct with all the
      grim local colouring of those narrow, squalid, fever-stricken dens, where
      misfortune and crime huddle together indiscriminately in dirt and misery&mdash;a
      book to make one&rsquo;s blood run cold with awe and disgust, and to stir
      up even the callous apathy of the great rich capitalist West End to a
      passing moment&rsquo;s ineffective remorse; but very clever and very
      graphic after its own sort beyond the shadow of a question, for all its
      horror. When Arthur Berkeley turned over the first proof-sheets of &lsquo;London&rsquo;s
      Shame,&rsquo; with its simple yet thrilling recital of true tales taken
      down from the very lips of outcast children or stranded women, with its
      awful woodcuts and still more awful descriptions&mdash;word-pictures
      reeking with the vice and filth and degradation of the most pestilent,
      overcrowded, undrained tenements&mdash;he felt instinctively that Ernest
      Le Breton&rsquo;s book would not need the artificial aid of Lady Hilda&rsquo;s
      influential friends in order to make it successful and even famous. The
      Cabinet ministers might be as silent as they chose, the indignant duke
      might confine his denunciations to the attentive and sympathetic ear of
      his friend Lord Connemara; but nothing on earth could prevent Ernest Le
      Breton&rsquo;s fiery and scathing diatribe from immediately enthralling
      the public attention. Lady Hilda had hit upon the exact subject which best
      suited his peculiar character and temperament, and he had done himself
      full justice in it. Not that Ernest had ever thought of himself, or even
      of his style, or the effect he was producing by his narrative; it was just
      the very non-self-consciousness of the thing that gave it its power. He
      wrote down the simple thoughts that came up into his own eager mind at the
      sight of so much inequality and injustice; and the motto that Arthur
      prefixed upon the title-page, &lsquo;Facit indignatio versum,&rsquo; aptly
      described the key-note of that fierce and angry final denunciation.
      &lsquo;Yes, Lady Hilda had certainly hit the right nail on the head,&rsquo;
      Arthur Berkeley said to himself more than once: ‘A wonderful woman, truly,
      that beautiful, stately, uncompromising, brilliant, and still really
      tender Hilda Tregellis.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda, on her part, worked hard and well for the success of Ernest&rsquo;s
      book as soon as it appeared. Nay, she even condescended (not being what
      Ernest himself would have described as an ethical unit) to practise a
      little gentle hypocrisy in suiting her recommendations of &lsquo;London&rsquo;s
      Shame&rsquo; to the tastes and feelings of her various acquaintances. To
      her Radical Cabinet minister friend, she openly praised its outspoken zeal
      for the cause of the people, and its value as a wonderful storehouse of
      useful facts at first hand for political purposes in the increasingly
      important outlying Metropolitan boroughs. &lsquo;Just think, Sir Edmund,&rsquo;
      she said, persuasively, &lsquo;how you could crush any Conservative
      candidate for Hackney or the Tower Hamlets out of that awful chapter on
      the East End match-makers;&rsquo; while with the Duke, to whom she
      presented a marked copy as a sample of what our revolutionary thinkers
      were really coming to, she insisted rather upon its wicked interference
      with the natural rights of landlords, and its abominable insinuation (so
      subversive of all truly English ideas as to liberty and property) that
      they were bound not to poison their tenants by total neglect of sanitary
      precautions. &lsquo;If I were you, now,&rsquo; she said to the Duke in the
      most seemingly simple-minded manner possible, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d just quote
      those passages I&rsquo;ve marked in pencil in the House to-night on the
      Small Urban Holdings Bill, and point out how the wave of Continental
      Socialism is at last invading England with its devastating flood.&rsquo;
      And the Duke, who was a complacent, thick-headed, obstinate old gentleman,
      congenitally incapable of looking at any question from any other point of
      view whatsoever except that of his own order, fell headlong passively into
      Lady Hilda&rsquo;s cruel little trap, and murmured to himself as he rolled
      down luxuriously to the august society of his peers that evening, &lsquo;Tremendous
      clever girl, Hilda Tregellis, really. &ldquo;Wave of Continental Socialism
      at last invading England with its what-you-may-call-it flood,&rdquo; she
      said, if I remember rightly. Capital sentence to end off one&rsquo;s
      speech with, I declare. Devizes&rsquo;ll positively wonder where I got it
      from. I&rsquo;d no idea before that girl took such an intelligent interest
      in political questions. So they want their cottages whitewashed, do they?
      What&rsquo;ll they ask for next, I wonder? Do they think we&rsquo;re to be
      content at last with one and a-half per cent, upon the fee-simple value of
      our estates, I should like to know? Why, some of the places this
      writer-fellow talks about are on my own property in The Rookery&mdash;&ldquo;one
      of the most noisome court-yards in all London,&rdquo; he actually calls
      it. Whitewash their cottages, indeed! The lazy improvident creatures! They&rsquo;ll
      be asking us to put down encaustic tiles upon the floors next, and to
      paper their walls with Japanese leather or fashionable dados. Really, the
      general ignorance that prevails among the working classes as to the
      clearest principles of political economy is something absolutely
      appalling, absolutely appalling.&rsquo; And his Grace scribbled a note in
      his memorandum-book of Hilda&rsquo;s ready-made peroration, for fear he
      should forget its precise wording before he began to give the House the
      benefit of his views that night upon the political economy of Small Urban
      Holdings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, all London was talking of the curious coincidence by which a
      book from the pen of an unknown author, published only one day previously,
      had been quoted and debated upon simultaneously in both Houses of
      Parliament on a single evening. In the Commons, Sir Edmund Calverley, the
      distinguished Radical minister, had read a dozen pages from the unknown
      work in his declamatory theatrical fashion, and had so electrified the
      House with its graphic and horrible details that even Mr.
      Fitzgerald-Grenville, the well-known member for the Baroness
      Drummond-Lloyd (whose rotten or at least decomposing borough of Cherbury
      Minor he faithfully represented in three successive Parliaments), had
      mumbled out a few half-inaudible apologetic sentences about this state of
      things being truly deplorable, and about the necessity for meeting such a
      distressing social crisis by the prompt and vigorous application of that
      excellent specific and familiar panacea, a spirited foreign policy. In the
      Lords, the Duke himself, by some untoward coincidence, had been moved to
      make a few quotations, accompanied by a running fire of essentially ducal
      criticism, from the very selfsame obscure author; and to his immense
      surprise, even the members of his own party moved uneasily in their seats
      during the course of his speech; while later in the evening, Lord Devizes
      muttered to him angrily in the robing-room, &lsquo;Look here, Duke, you&rsquo;ve
      been and put your foot in it, I assure you, about that Radical book you
      were ill-advised enough to quote from. You ought never to have treated the
      Small Urban Holdings Bill in the way you did; and just you mark my words,
      the papers&rsquo;ll all be down upon you to-morrow morning, as sure as
      daylight. You&rsquo;ve given the &ldquo;Bystander&rdquo; such an opening
      against you as you&rsquo;ll never forget till your dying day, I can tell
      you.&rsquo; And as the Duke drove back again after his arduous legislative
      efforts that evening, he said to himself between the puffs at his Havana,
      &lsquo;This comes, now, of allowing oneself to be made a fool of by a
      handsome woman. How the dooce I could ever have gone and taken Hilda
      Tregellis&rsquo;s advice on a political question is really more than I can
      fathom:&mdash;and at my time of life too! And yet, all the same, there&rsquo;s
      no denying that she&rsquo;s a devilish fine woman, by Jove, if ever there
      was one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, everybody asked themselves next day what this book ‘London&rsquo;s
      Shame&rsquo; was like, and who on earth its author could be; so much so,
      indeed, that a large edition was completely exhausted within a fortnight.
      It was the great sensational success of that London season. Everybody read
      it, discussed it, dissected it, corroborated it, refuted it, fought over
      it, and wrote lengthy letters to all the daily papers about its faults and
      its merits. Imitators added their sincerest flattery: rivals proclaimed
      themselves the original discoverers of &lsquo;London&rsquo;s Shame&rsquo;:
      one enterprising author even thought of going to law about it as a
      question of copyright. Owners of noisome lanes in the East End trembled in
      their shoes, and sent their agents to inquire into the precise degree of
      squalor to be found in the filthy courts and alleys where they didn&rsquo;t
      care to trust their own sensitive aristocratic noses. It even seemed as if
      a little real good was going to come at last out of Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s
      impassioned pleading&mdash;as if the sensation were going to fall not
      quite flat at the end of its short run in the clubs and drawing-rooms of
      London as a nine days&rsquo; wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ernest Le Breton? and Edie? In the little lodgings at Holloway, they
      sat first trembling for the result, and ready to burst with excitement
      when Lady Hilda, up at the unwonted hour of six in the morning, tore into
      their rooms with an early copy of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; to show them the
      Duke&rsquo;s speech, and Sir Edmund&rsquo;s quotations, and the editorial
      leader in which even that most dignified and reticent of British journals
      condescended to speak with studiously moderated praise of the immense
      collection of facts so ably strung together by Mr. Ernest Le Breton (in
      all the legible glory of small capitals, too,) as to the undoubtedly
      disgraceful condition of some at least among our London alleys. How Edie
      clung around Lady Hilda and kissed her! and how Lady Hilda kissed her back
      and cried over her with tears of happier augury! and how they both kissed
      and cried over unconscious wondering little Dot! And how Lady Hilda could
      almost have fallen upon Ernest, too, as he sat gazing in blank
      astonishment and delight at his own name in the magnificent small capitals
      of a &lsquo;Times&rsquo; leader. Between crying and laughing, with much
      efficient aid in both from good Mrs. Halliss, they hardly knew how they
      ever got through the long delightful hours of that memorable epoch-making
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there came the gradual awakening to the fact that this was really
      fame&mdash;fame, and perhaps also competence. First in the field, of
      course, was the editor of the &lsquo;Cosmopolitan Review,&rsquo; with a
      polite request that Ernest would give the readers of that intensely
      hot-and-hot and thoughtful periodical the opportunity of reading his
      valuable views on the East End outcast question, before they had had time
      to be worth nothing for journalistic purposes, through the natural and
      inevitable cooling of the public interest in this new sensation. Then his
      old friends of the &lsquo;Morning Intelligence&rsquo; once more begged
      that he would be good enough to contribute a series of signed and headed
      articles to their columns, on the slums and fever dens of poverty-stricken
      London. Next, an illustrated weekly asked him to join with his artist
      friend in getting up another pilgrimage into yet undiscovered metropolitan
      plague-spots. And so, before the end of a month, Ernest Le Breton, for the
      first time in his life, had really got more work to do than he could
      easily manage, and work, too, that he felt he could throw his whole life
      and soul into with perfect honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first edition of &lsquo;London&rsquo;s Shame&rsquo; was
      exhausted, there was already a handsome balance to go to Ernest and his
      artist coadjutor, who, by the terms of the agreement, were to divide
      between them half the profits. The other half, for appearance&rsquo; sake,
      Lady Hilda and Arthur had been naturally compelled to reserve for
      themselves: for of course it would not have been probable that any
      publisher would have undertaken the work without any hope of profit in any
      way. Arthur called upon Hilda at Lord Exmoor&rsquo;s house in Wilton Place
      to show her the first balance-sheet and accompanying cheque. &lsquo;What
      on earth can we do with it?&rsquo; he asked seriously. &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t
      divide it between us: and yet we can&rsquo;t give it to the poor Le
      Bretons. I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re to manage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, of course,&rsquo; Hilda answered promptly. &lsquo;Put it into the
      Consols or whatever you call it, for the benefit of little Dot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The very thing!&rsquo; Arthur answered in a tone of obvious admiration.
      ‘What a wonderfully practical person you really are, Lady Hilda.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Ernest and Edie, when they got their own cheque for their quarter of
      the proceeds, they gazed in awe and astonishment at the bigness of the
      figure; and then they sat down and cried together like two children, with
      their hands locked in one another&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And you&rsquo;ll get well, now, Ernest dear,&rsquo; Edie whispered
      gently. ‘Why, you&rsquo;re ever so much fatter, darling, already. I&rsquo;m
      sure you&rsquo;ll get well in no time, now, Ernest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Upon my word, Edie,&rsquo; Ernest answered, kissing her white forehead
      tenderly, &lsquo;I really and truly believe I shall. It&rsquo;s my opinion
      that Sir Antony Wraxall&rsquo;s an unmitigated ignorant humbug.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks later, when Ernest&rsquo;s remarkable article on &lsquo;How to
      Improve the Homes of the Poor&rsquo; appeared in one of the leading
      magazines, Mr. Herbert Le Breton of the Education Office looked up from
      his cup of post-prandial coffee in his comfortable dining-room at South
      Kensington, and said musingly to his young wife, &lsquo;Do you know,
      Ethel, it seems to me that my brother Ernest&rsquo;s going to score a
      success at last with this slum-hunting business that he&rsquo;s lately
      invented. There&rsquo;s an awful lot about it now in all the papers and
      reviews. Perhaps it might be as well, after all, to scrape an acquaintance
      with him again, especially as he&rsquo;s my own brother. There&rsquo;s no
      knowing, really, when a man of his peculiar ill-regulated mercurial
      temperament may be going to turn out famous. Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d
      better find out where they&rsquo;re living now&mdash;they&rsquo;ve left
      Holloway, no doubt, since this turn of the tide&mdash;and go and call upon
      Mrs. Ernest?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereto Mrs. Herbert Le Breton, raising her eyes for a moment from the
      pages of her last new novel, answered languidly: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      think, Herbert, it&rsquo;d be better to wait a little while and see how
      things turn out with them in the long run, you know, before we commit
      ourselves by going to call upon them? One swallow, you see, doesn&rsquo;t
      make a summer, does it, dear, ever?&rsquo; Whence the acute and
      intelligent reader will doubtless conclude that Mrs. Herbert Le Breton was
      a very prudent sensible young woman, and that perhaps even Herbert himself
      had met at last with his fitting Nemesis. For what worse purgatory could
      his bitterest foe wish for a selfishly prudent and cold-hearted man, than
      that he should pass his whole lifetime in congenial intercourse with a
      selfishly prudent and cold-hearted wife, exactly after his own pattern?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; OUT OF THE HAND OP THE PHILISTINES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ernest&rsquo;s unexpected success with &lsquo;London&rsquo;s Shame&rsquo;
      was not, as Arthur Berkeley at first feared it might be, the mere last
      dying flicker of a weak and failing life. Arthur was quite right, indeed,
      when he said one day to Lady Hilda that its very brilliancy and fervour
      had the hectic glow about it, as of a man who was burning himself out too
      fiercely and rapidly; you could read the feverish eagerness of the writer
      in every line; but still, Lady Hilda answered with her ordinary calm
      assurance that it was all going well, and that Ernest only needed the
      sense of security to pull him round again; and as usual, Lady Hilda&rsquo;s
      practical sagacity was not at fault. The big pamphlet&mdash;for it was
      hardly more than that&mdash;soon proved an opening for further work, in
      procuring which Hilda and Arthur were again partially instrumental. An
      advanced Radical member of Parliament, famous for his declamations against
      the capitalist faction, and his enormous holding of English railway stock,
      was induced to come forward as the founder of a new weekly paper, ‘in the
      interest of social reform.&rsquo; Of course the thing was got up solely
      with an idea to utilising Ernest as editor, for, said the great
      anti-capitalist with his usual charming frankness, &lsquo;the young fellow
      has a positive money-value, now, if he&rsquo;s taken in hand at once
      before the sensation&rsquo;s over, and there can be no harm in turning an
      honest penny by exploiting him, you know, and starting a popular paper.&rsquo;
      When Ernest was offered the post of editor to the new periodical, at a
      salary which almost alarmed him by its plutocratic magnificence (for it
      was positively no less than six hundred a year), he felt for a moment some
      conscientious scruples about accepting so splendid a post. And when Lady
      Hilda in her emphatic fashion promptly over-ruled these nascent scruples
      by the application of the very simple solvent formula, &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo;
      he felt bound at least to stipulate that he should be at perfect liberty
      to say whatever he liked in the new paper, without interference or
      supervision from the capitalist proprietor. To which the Radical member,
      in his business capacity, immediately responded, &lsquo;Why, certainly.
      What we want to pay you for is just your power of startling people, which,
      in its proper place, is a very useful marketable commodity. Every pig has
      its value&mdash;if only you sell it in the best market.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Social Reformer, a Weekly Advocate of the New Economy,&rsquo;
      achieved at once an immense success among the working classes, and grew
      before long to be one of the most popular journals of the second rank in
      all London. The interest that Ernest had aroused by his big pamphlet was
      carried on to his new venture, which soon managed to gain many readers by
      its own intrinsic merits. &lsquo;Seen your brother&rsquo;s revolutionary
      broadsheet, Le Breton?&rsquo; asked a friend at the club of Herbert not
      many weeks later&mdash;he was the same person who had found it &lsquo;so
      very embarrassing&rsquo; to recognise Ernest&mdash;in his shabby days when
      walking with a Q.C.&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadful tissue of the
      reddest French communism, I believe, but still, it&rsquo;s scored the
      biggest success of its sort in journalism, I&rsquo;m told, since the days
      of Kenealy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Englishman.&rdquo; Bradbury, who&rsquo;s found
      the money to start it&mdash;deuced clever fellow in his way, Bradbury!&mdash;is
      making an awful lot out of the speculation, they say. What do you think of
      the paper, eh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert drew himself up grimly. &lsquo;To tell you the truth,&rsquo; he
      said in his stiffest style, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet had time to look at
      a copy. Ernest Le Breton&rsquo;s not a man in whose affairs I feel called
      upon to take any special interest; and I haven&rsquo;t put myself to the
      trouble of reading his second-hand political lucubrations. Faint echoes of
      Max Schurz, all of it, no doubt; and having read and disposed of Schurz
      himself long ago, I don&rsquo;t feel inclined now to go in for a second
      supplementary course of Schurz and water.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, well, that may be so,&rsquo; the friend answered, turning over the
      pages of the peccant periodical carelessly; &lsquo;but all the same I&rsquo;m
      afraid your brother&rsquo;s really going to do an awful lot of mischief in
      the way of setting class against class, and stirring up the dangerous
      orders to recognise their own power. You see, Le Breton, the real danger
      of this sort of thing lies in the fact that your brother Ernest&rsquo;s a
      more or less educated and cultivated person. I don&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s
      really got any genuine depth of culture&mdash;would you believe it, he
      told me once he&rsquo;d never read Rabelais, and didn&rsquo;t want to?&mdash;and
      of course a man of true culture in the grain, like you and me now, my dear
      fellow, would never dream of going and mistaking these will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps
      of socialism for the real guiding light of regenerated humanity&mdash;of
      course not. But the dangerous symptom at the present day lies just in the
      fact that while the papers written for the mob used to be written by
      vulgar, noisy, self-made, half-educated demagogues, they&rsquo;re sent out
      now with all the authority and specious respectability of decently
      instructed and comparatively literary English gentlemen. Now, nobody can
      deny that that&rsquo;s a thing very seriously to be regretted; and for my
      part I&rsquo;m extremely sorry your brother has been ill-advised enough to
      join the mob that&rsquo;s trying to pull down our comfortably built and
      after all eminently respectable, even if somewhat patched up, old British
      constitution.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The subject&rsquo;s one,&rsquo; Herbert answered curtly, &lsquo;in which
      I for my part cannot pretend to feel the remotest personal interest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest and Edie, howerer, in the little lodgings up at Holloway, which
      they couldn&rsquo;t bear to desert even now in this sudden burst of
      incredible prosperity, went their own way as self-containedly as usual,
      wholly unconcerned by the non-arrival of Mrs. Herbert on a visit of
      ceremony, or the failure of the &lsquo;Social Reformer&rsquo; to pierce
      the lofty ethereal regions of abstract contemplation where Herbert himself
      sat throned like an Epicurean god in the pure halo of cultivated
      pococurantism. Every day, as that eminent medical authority, Hilda
      Tregellis, had truly prophesied, Ernest&rsquo;s cheeks grew less and less
      sunken, and a little colour returned slowly to their midst; while Edie&rsquo;s
      face was less pale than of old, and her smile began to recover something
      of its old-fashioned girlish joyousness. She danced about once more as of
      old, and Arthur Berkeley, when he dropped in of a Sunday afternoon for a
      chat with Ernest, noticed with pleasure that little Miss Butterfly was
      beginning to flit round again almost as naturally as in the old days when
      he first saw her light little form among the grey old pillars of Magdalen
      Cloisters. Yet he couldn&rsquo;t help observing, too, that his feeling
      towards her was more one of mere benevolence now, and less of tender
      regret, than it used to be even a few short months before, in the darkest
      days of Edie&rsquo;s troubles. Could it be, he asked himself more than
      once, that the tall stately picture of Hilda Tregellis was overshadowing
      in his heart the natural photograph of that unwedded Edie Oswald that he
      once imagined was so firmly imprinted there? Ah well, ah well, it may be
      true that a man can love really but once in his whole lifetime; and yet,
      the second spurious imitation is positively sometimes a very good
      facsimile of the genuine first impression, for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the months went slowly round, too, the time came in the end for good
      Herr Max to be released at last from his long imprisonment. On the day
      that he came out, there was a public banquet at the Marylebone dancing
      saloon; and all the socialists and communards were there, and all the
      Russian nihilists, and all the other wicked revolutionary plotters in all
      London: and in the chair sat Ernest Le Breton, now the editor of an
      important social paper, while at his left hand, to balance the guest of
      the evening, sat Arthur Berkeley, the well-known dramatic author, who was
      himself more than suspected of being the timid Nicodemus of the new faith.
      And when Ernest announced that Herr Schurz had consented to aid him on the
      ‘Social Reformer,&rsquo; and to add the wisdom of age to the impetuosity
      of youth in conducting its future, the simple enthusiasm of the wicked
      revolutionists knew no bounds. And they cried &lsquo;Hoch!&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;Viva!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hooray!&rsquo; and many other like
      inarticulate shouts in many varieties of interjectional dialect all the
      evening; and everybody agreed that after all Herr Max was VERY little
      grayer than before the trial, in spite of his long and terrible term of
      imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He WAS a little embittered by his troubles, no doubt;&mdash;what can you
      expect if you clap men in prison for the expression of their honest
      political convictions?&mdash;but Ernest tried to keep his eye steadily
      rather on the future than on the past; and with greater ease and unwonted
      comforts the old man&rsquo;s cheerfulness as well as his enthusiasm
      gradually returned. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m too old now to do anything more worth
      doing myself before I die,&rsquo; he used to say, holding Ernest&rsquo;s
      arm tightly in his vice-like grip: &lsquo;but I have great hopes in spite
      of everything for friend Ernest; I have very great hopes indeed for friend
      Ernest here. There&rsquo;s no knowing yet what he may accomplish.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest only smiled a trifle sadly, and murmured half to himself that this
      was a hard world, and he began himself to fear there was no fitting
      feeling for a social reformer except one of a brave despair. ‘We can do
      little or nothing, after all,&rsquo; he said slowly; &lsquo;and our only
      consolation must be that even that little is perhaps just worth doing.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. &mdash; LAND AT LAST: BUT WHAT LAND?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Long before the &lsquo;Social Reformer&rsquo; had fully made its mark in
      the world, another event had happened of no less importance to some of the
      chief actors in the little drama whose natural termination it seemed to
      form. While the pamphlet and the paper were in course of maturation,
      Arthur Berkeley had been running daily in and out of the house in Wilton
      Place in what Lady Exmoor several times described as a positively
      disgraceful and unseemly manner. (&lsquo;What Hilda can mean,&rsquo; her
      ladyship observed to her husband more than once, &lsquo;by encouraging
      that odd young man&rsquo;s extraordinary advances in the way she does is
      really more than I can understand even in her.&rsquo;) But when the Le
      Bretons were fairly launched at last on the favourable flood of full
      prosperity, both Hilda and Arthur began to feel as though they had
      suddenly been deprived of a very pleasant common interest. After all,
      benevolent counsel on behalf of other people is not so entirely innocent
      and impersonal in certain cases as it seems to be at first sight. &lsquo;Do
      you know, Lady Hilda,&rsquo; Berkeley said one afternoon, when he had come
      to pay, as it were, a sort of farewell visit, on the final completion of
      their joint schemes for restoring happiness to the home of the Le Bretons,
      ‘our intercourse together has been very delightful, and I&rsquo;m quite
      sorry to think that in future we must see so much less of one another than
      we&rsquo;ve been in the habit of doing for the last month or so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda looked at him straight and said in her own frank unaffected fashion,
      &lsquo;So am I, Mr. Berkeley, very sorry, very sorry indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked back at her once more, and their eyes met. His look was full
      of admiration, and Hilda saw it. She moved a little uneasily upon the
      ottoman, waiting apparently as though she expected Arthur to say something
      else. But Arthur looked at her long and steadfastly, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he seemed to wake from his reverie, and make up his mind for a
      desperate venture. Could he be mistaken? Could he have read either record
      wrong&mdash;his own heart, or Hilda&rsquo;s eyes? No, no, both of them
      spoke to him too plainly and evidently. His heart was fluttering like a
      wind-shaken aspen-leaf; and Hilda&rsquo;s eyes were dimming visibly with a
      tender moisture. Yes, yes, yes, there was no misreading possible. He knew
      he loved her! he knew she loved him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending over towards where Hilda sat, he took her hand in his dreamily:
      and Hilda let him take it without a movement. Then he looked deeply into
      her eyes, and felt a curious speechlessness coming over him, deep down in
      the ball of his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lady Hilda,&rsquo; he began at last with an effort, in a low voice, not
      wholly untinged with natural timidity, &lsquo;Lady Hilda, is a working man&rsquo;s
      son&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda looked back at him with a sudden look of earnest deprecation. ‘Not
      that way, Mr. Berkeley,&rsquo; she said quietly: &lsquo;not that way,
      please: you&rsquo;ll hurt me if you do: you know that&rsquo;s not the way
      <i>I</i> look at the matter. Why not simply &ldquo;Hilda&rdquo;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Berkeley clasped her hand eagerly and raised it to his lips. &lsquo;Hilda,
      then,&rsquo; he said, kissing it twice over. &lsquo;It SHALL be Hilda.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda rose and stood before him erect in all her queenlike beauty. ‘So now
      that&rsquo;s settled,&rsquo; she said, with a vain endeavour to control
      her tears of joy. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it any more,
      now; I can&rsquo;t bear to talk about it: there&rsquo;s nothing to
      arrange, Arthur. Whenever you like will suit me. But, oh, I&rsquo;m so
      happy, so happy, so happy&mdash;I never thought I could be so happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nor I,&rsquo; Arthur answered, holding her hand a moment in his tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How strange,&rsquo; Hilda said again, after a minute&rsquo;s delicious
      silence; ‘it&rsquo;s the poor Le Bretons who have brought us two thus
      together. And yet, they were both once our dearest rivals. YOU were in
      love with Edie Le Breton: <i>I</i> was half in love with Ernest Le Breton:
      and now&mdash;why, now, Arthur, I DO believe we&rsquo;re both utterly in
      love with one another. What a curious little comedy of errors!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And yet only a few months ago it came very near being a tragedy, rather,&rsquo;
      Arthur put in softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never mind!&rsquo; Hilda answered in her brightest and most joyous tone,
      as she wiped the joyful tears from her eyes. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t a
      tragedy, now, after all, Arthur, and all&rsquo;s well that ends well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Countess heard of Hilda&rsquo;s determination&mdash;Hilda didn&rsquo;t
      pretend to go through the domestic farce of asking her mother&rsquo;s
      consent to her approaching marriage&mdash;she said that so far as she was
      concerned a more shocking or un-Christian piece of conduct on the part of
      a well-brought-up girl had never yet been brought to her knowledge. To
      refuse Lord Connemara, and then go and marry the son of a common cobbler!
      But the Earl only puffed away vigorously at his cheroot, and observed
      philosophically that for his part he just considered himself jolly well
      out of it. This young fellow Berkeley mightn&rsquo;t be a man of the sort
      of family Hilda would naturally expect to marry into, but he was decently
      educated and in good society, and above all, a gentleman, you know, don&rsquo;t
      you know: and, hang it all, in these days that&rsquo;s really everything.
      Besides, Berkeley was making a pot of money out of these operas of his,
      the Earl understood, and as he had always expected that Hilda&rsquo;d
      marry some penniless painter or somebody of that sort, and be a perpetual
      drag upon the family exchequer, he really didn&rsquo;t see why they need
      trouble their heads very much about it. By George, if it came to that, he
      rather congratulated himself that the girl hadn&rsquo;t taken it into her
      nonsensical head to run away with the groom or the stable-boy! As to
      Lynmouth, he merely remarked succinctly in his own dialect, &lsquo;Go it,
      Hilda, go it, my beauty! You always were a one-er, you know, and it&rsquo;s
      my belief you always will be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was somewhere about the same time that Ronald Le Breton, coming back
      gladdened in soul from a cheerful talk with Ernest, called round of an
      evening in somewhat unwonted exultation at Selah&rsquo;s lodgings. &lsquo;Selah,&rsquo;
      he said to her calmly, as she met him at the door to let him in herself,
      &lsquo;I want to have a little talk with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is it about, Ronald?&rsquo; Selah asked, with a perfect
      consciousness in her own mind of what the subject he wished to discourse
      about was likely to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, Selah,&rsquo; Ronald went on in his quiet, matter-of-fact,
      unobtrusive manner, &lsquo;do you know, I think we may fairly consider
      Ernest and Edie out of danger now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope so, Ronald,&rsquo; Selah answered imperturbably. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      no doubt your brother&rsquo;ll get along all right in future, and I&rsquo;m
      sure at least that he&rsquo;s getting stronger, for he looks ten per cent.
      better than he did three months ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Selah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Ronald!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, in that case, you see, your objection falls to the ground. There can
      be no possible reason on either side why you should any longer put off
      marrying me. We needn&rsquo;t consider Edie now; and you can&rsquo;t have
      any reasonable doubt that I want to marry you for your own sake this time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What a nuisance the man is!&rsquo; Selah cried impetuously. &lsquo;Always
      bothering a body out of her nine senses to go and marry him. Have you
      never read what Paul says, that it&rsquo;s good for the unmarried and
      widows to abide? He was always dead against the advisability of marriage,
      Paul was.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Brother Paul was an able and earnest preacher,&rsquo; Ronald murmured
      gravely, &lsquo;from whose authority I should be sorry to dissent except
      for sufficient and weighty reason; but you must admit that on this
      particular question he was prejudiced, Selah, decidedly prejudiced, and
      that the balance of the best opinion goes distinctly the other way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah laughed lightly. &lsquo;Oh, does it?&rsquo; she said, in her
      provoking, mocking manner. &lsquo;Then you propose to marry me, I suppose,
      on the balance of the best Scriptural opinion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all, Selah,&rsquo; Ronald replied without a touch of anything but
      grave earnestness in his tone&mdash;it must be admitted Ronald was
      distinctly lacking in the sense of humour. &lsquo;Not at all, I assure
      you. I propose to marry you because I love you, and I believe in your
      heart of hearts you love me, too, you provoking girl, though you&rsquo;re
      too proud or too incomprehensible ever to acknowledge it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And even if I do?&rsquo; Selah asked. &lsquo;What then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, then, Selah,&rsquo; Ronald answered confidently, taking her hand
      boldly in his own and actually kissing her&mdash;yes, kissing her; &lsquo;why,
      then, Selah, suppose we say Monday fortnight?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It&rsquo;s awfully soon,&rsquo; Selah replied, half grumbling. &lsquo;You
      don&rsquo;t give a body time to think it over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Certainly not,&rsquo; Ronald responded, quickly, taking the handsome face
      firmly between his two spare hands, and kissing her lips half a dozen
      times over in rapid succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let me go, Ronald,&rsquo; Selah cried, struggling to be free, and trying
      in vain to tear down his thin wiry arms with her own strong shapely hands.
      &lsquo;Let me go at once,&mdash;there&rsquo;s a good boy, and I&rsquo;ll
      marry you on Monday fortnight, or do anything else you like, just to keep
      you quiet. After all, you&rsquo;re a kind-hearted fellow enough, and you
      want looking after and taking care of, and if you insist upon it, I don&rsquo;t
      mind giving way to you in this small matter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronald stepped back a pace or two, and stood looking at her a little sadly
      with his hands folded. &lsquo;Oh, Selah,&rsquo; he cried in a tone of
      bitter disappointment, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t speak like that to me, don&rsquo;t,
      please. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t tell me that you don&rsquo;t really love
      me&mdash;that you&rsquo;re going to marry me for nothing else but out of
      mere compassion for my weakness and helplessness!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Selah burst at once into a wild flood of uncontrollable tears: &lsquo;Oh,
      Ronald,&rsquo; she cried in her old almost fiercely passionate manner,
      flinging her arms around his neck and covering him with kisses; ‘Oh,
      Ronald, how can you ever ask me whether I really really love you! You know
      I love you! You know I love you! You&rsquo;ve given me back life and
      everything that&rsquo;s dear in it, and I never want to live for anything
      any longer except to love you, and wait upon you, and make you happy. I&rsquo;m
      stronger than you, Ronald, and I shall be able to do a little to make you
      happy, I do believe. My ways are not your ways, nor my thoughts your
      thoughts, my darling; but I love you all the better for that, Ronald, I
      love you all the better for that; and if you were to kick me, beat me,
      trample on me now, Ronald, I should love you, love you, love you for ever
      still.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they two were quietly married, with no audience save Ernest and Edie,
      on that very Monday fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Herbert Le Breton heard of it from his mother a few days later, he
      went home at once to his own eminently cultured home and told Mrs. Le
      Breton the news, of course without much detailed allusion to Selah&rsquo;s
      earlier antecedents. &lsquo;And do you know, Ethel,&rsquo; he added
      significantly, &lsquo;I think it was an excellent thing that you decided
      not to call after all upon Ernest&rsquo;s wife, for I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll
      be a great deal safer for you and me to have nothing to say in any way to
      the whole faction of them. A greengrocer&rsquo;s daughter, you know&mdash;quite
      unpresentable. They&rsquo;ll be all mixed up together in future, which&rsquo;ll
      make it quite impossible to know the one without at the same time knowing
      the other. Now, it&rsquo;d be just practicable for you to call upon Mrs.
      Ernest, I must admit, but to call upon Mrs. Ronald would be really and
      truly too inconceivable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the first year of the &lsquo;Social Reformer,&rsquo; the
      annual balance was duly audited, and it showed a very considerable and
      solid surplus to go into the pocket of the enterprising Radical
      proprietor. Ernest and Herr Max scanned it closely together, and even
      Ernest could not refrain from a smile of pleasure when he saw how
      thoroughly successful the doubtful venture had finally turned out. &lsquo;And
      yet,&rsquo; he said regretfully, as he looked at the heavy balance-sheet,
      &lsquo;what a strange occupation after all for the author of &ldquo;Gold
      and the Proletariate,&rdquo; to be looking carefully over the sum-total of
      a capitalist&rsquo;s final balance! To think, too, that all that money has
      come out of the hard-earned scraped-up pennies of the toiling poor! I
      often wish, Herr Max, that even so I had been brought up an honest
      shoemaker! But whether I&rsquo;m really earning my salt at the hands of
      humanity now or not is a deep problem I often have many an uncomfortable
      internal sigh over to this day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There is work and work, friend Ernest,&rsquo; Herr Max answered, as
      gently as had been his wont in older years; &lsquo;and for my part it
      seems to me you are better here writing your Social Reformers than making
      shoes for a single generation. One man builds for to-day, another man
      builds for to-morrow; and he that plants a fruit tree for his children to
      eat of is doing as much good work in the world as he that sows the corn in
      spring to be reaped and eaten at this autumn&rsquo;s harvest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps so,&rsquo; Ernest answered softly. &lsquo;I wish I could think
      so. But after all I&rsquo;m not quite sure whether, if we had all starved
      eighteen months ago together, as seemed so likely then, it wouldn&rsquo;t
      have been the most right thing in the end that could possibly have
      happened to all of us. As things are constituted now, there seems only one
      life that&rsquo;s really worth living for an honest man, and that&rsquo;s
      a martyr&rsquo;s. A martyr&rsquo;s or else a worker&rsquo;s. And I, I
      greatly fear, have managed somehow to miss being either. The wind carries
      us this way and that, and when we would do that which is right, it drifts
      us away incontinently into that which is only profitable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear Ernest,&rsquo; Edie cried in her bright old-fashioned manner from
      the office door, &lsquo;Dot has come in her new frock to bring Daddy home
      for her birthday dinner as she was promised. Come quick, or your little
      daughter&rsquo;ll be very angry with you. And Lady Hilda Berkeley has
      come, too, to drive us back in her own brougham. Now don&rsquo;t be a
      silly, there&rsquo;s a dear, or say that you can&rsquo;t drive away from
      the office of the &ldquo;Social Reformer&rdquo; in Lady Hilda&rsquo;s
      brougham!&rsquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
